Drawing on web browsing data, archives of fact-checking websites, and results from a new online survey, we find: 1) social media was an important but not dominant source of election news, with 14 percent of Americans calling social media their ``most important'' source; 2) of the known false news stories that appeared in the three months before the election, those favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared 8 million times; 3) the average American adult saw on the order of one or perhaps several fake news stories in the months around the election, with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them; and 4) people are much more likely to believe stories that favor their preferred candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.},

  abstract = {Topic modeling is used for discovering latent semantic structure, usually referred to as topics, in a large collection of documents. The most widely used methods are Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. Despite their popularity they have several weaknesses. In order to achieve optimal results they often require the number of topics to be known, custom stop-word lists, stemming, and lemmatization. Additionally these methods rely on bag-of-words representation of documents which ignore the ordering and semantics of words. Distributed representations of documents and words have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantics of words and documents. We present \${\textbackslash}texttt\{top2vec\}\$, which leverages joint document and word semantic embedding to find \${\textbackslash}textit\{topic vectors\}\$. This model does not require stop-word lists, stemming or lemmatization, and it automatically finds the number of topics. The resulting topic vectors are jointly embedded with the document and word vectors with distance between them representing semantic similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that \${\textbackslash}texttt\{top2vec\}\$ finds topics which are significantly more informative and representative of the corpus trained on than probabilistic generative models.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology for the forensic analysis of the artifacts generated on Android smartphones by Telegram Messenger, the official client for the Telegram instant messaging platform, which provides various forms of secure individual and group communication, by means of which both textual and non-textual messages can be exchanged among users, as well as voice calls. Our methodology is based on the design of a set of experiments suitable to elicit the generation of artifacts and their retention on the device storage, and on the use of virtualized smartphones to ensure the generality of the results and the full repeatability of the experiments, so that our findings can be reproduced and validated by a third-party. In this paper we show that, by using the proposed methodology, we are able (a) to identify all the artifacts generated by Telegram Messenger, (b) to decode and interpret each one of them, and (c) to correlate them in order to infer various types of information that cannot be obtained by considering each one of them in isolation. As a result, in this paper we show how to reconstruct the list of contacts, the chronology and contents of the messages that have been exchanged by users, as well as the contents of files that have been sent or received. Furthermore, we show how to determine significant properties of the various chats, groups, and channels in which the user has been involved (e.g., the identifier of the creator, the date of creation, the date of joining, etc.). Finally, we show how to reconstruct the log of the voice calls made or received by the user. Although in this paper we focus on Telegram Messenger, our methodology can be applied to the forensic analysis of any application running on the Android platform.},

While critical scholars have drawn attention to the social, political and legal challenges to these practices, the debates in computer and information science have received less analytical attention. This paper proposes to take seriously the critical knowledge developed in information and computer science and reinterpret their debates to develop a critical intervention into the public controversies concerning data-driven security and digital surveillance. The paper offers a two-pronged contribution: on the one hand, we challenge the credibility of security professionals' discourses in light of the knowledge that they supposedly mobilize; on the other, we argue for a series of conceptual moves around data, human--computer relations, and algorithms to address some of the limitations of existing engagements with the Big Data-security assemblage.},

  abstract = {The current study investigated the effect of using Telegram Messenger on Iranian EFL learners' vocabulary learning. From among 120 candidates, 100 of them were chosen randomly. After homogenizing the participants by Oxford Placement Test (OPT), 50 students were chosen as the main sample size and were randomly divided into two groups: one control and one experimental group, each having 25 students. Thereafter, the multiple choice vocabulary pretest was administered to all subjects to ensure their homogeneity prior the beginning of the study. Among all questions in pretest, 40 questions, which were not correctly answered, were chosen for teaching in next step. In the treatment period, students in experimental group were taught via Telegram Messenger while in the control group they were taught traditionally. After 8 sessions of treatment, the posttest was administered to assess the participants' improvement in both groups. The result of the Independent-Samples t-test revealed that students in experimental group had more progress than the students in the control group meaning that Telegram Messenger had significant effect on improving vocabulary knowledge of Iranian intermediate EFL learners. The findings consolidate the role of mobile phones as effective tools in teaching and learning vocabulary. Thus, it is hoped that the study encourages the EFL/ESL teachers to host this device in the classroom environments. The finding may also be beneficial for materials and curriculum developers in designing and preparing syllabi that are more adaptable with using MALL which may help language learners to learn vocabulary better.},

Yet it is not yet known how such tools might influence social science research. I argue Generative AI has the potential to improve survey research, online experiments, automated content analyses, agent-based models, and other techniques commonly used to study human behavior. In the second section of this article, I discuss the many limitations of Generative AI. I examine how bias in the data used to train these tools can negatively impact social science research---as well as a range of other challenges related to ethics, replication, environmental impact, and the proliferation of low-quality research. I conclude by arguing that social scientists can address many of these limitations by creating open-source infrastructure for research on human behavior. Such infrastructure is not only necessary to ensure broad access to high-quality research tools, I argue, but also because the progress of AI will require deeper understanding of the social forces that guide human behavior.}

In this paper, we present an analysis of monetization methods of conspiracy theorist YouTube creators and the types of advertisers potentially targeting this content. We collect 184,218 ad impressions from 6,347 unique advertisers found on conspiracy-focused channels and mainstream YouTube content. We classify the ads into business categories and compare their prevalence between conspiracy and mainstream content. We also identify common offsite monetization methods. In comparison with mainstream content, conspiracy videos had similar levels of ads from well-known brands, but an almost eleven times higher prevalence of likely predatory or deceptive ads. Additionally, we found that conspiracy channels were more than twice as likely as mainstream channels to use offsite monetization methods, and 53\% of the demonetized channels we observed were linking to third-party sites for alternative monetization opportunities. Our results indicate that conspiracy theorists on YouTube had many potential avenues to generate revenue, and that predatory ads were more frequently served for conspiracy videos.},

In this paper we present the workflow from our digital ethnography and consider the consequences of particular choices of action upon knowledge production. Key considerations that our workflow responded to include adapting to volatile field-sites, researcher safety in digital environments, data security and encryption, and ethical-legal challenges. We anticipate that this workflow may assist other researchers to emulate, test and adapt our approach to the diverse range of illicit studies online.

The internet has transformed the ways we think and act, and by consequence, our politics. The most impactful recent political movements on the far left and right started with massive online collectives of teenagers. Strangely, both movements began on the same website: an anime imageboard called 4chan.org. It Came from Something Awful is the fascinating and bizarre story of 4chan and its profound effect on youth counterculture. Dale Beran has observed the website's shifting activities and interests since the beginning. 4chan is a microcosm of the internet itself--simultaneously at the vanguard of contemporary culture, politics, comedy and language, and a new low for all of the above. It was the original meme machine, mostly frequented by socially awkward and disenfranchised young men in search of a place to be alone together. During the recession of the late 2000's, the memes became political. 4chan was the online hub of a leftist hacker collective known as Anonymous and a prominent supporter of the Occupy Wall Street movement. But within a few short years, the site's ideology spun on its axis; it became the birthplace and breeding ground of the alt-right. In It Came from Something Awful, Beran uses his insider's knowledge and natural storytelling ability to chronicle 4chan's strange journey from creating rage-comics to inciting riots to--according to some--memeing Donald Trump into the White House"--},

Yet there is a vocal anti-vaccination movement, featuring celebrity activists (including Kennedy scion Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and actress Jenny McCarthy) and the propagation of anti-vax claims through books, documentaries, and social media. In Anti-Vaxxers, Jonathan Berman explores the phenomenon of the anti-vaccination movement, recounting its history from its nineteenth-century antecedents to today's activism, examining its claims, and suggesting a strategy for countering them. After providing background information on vaccines and how they work, Berman describes resistance to Britain's Vaccination Act of 1853, showing that the arguments anticipate those made by today's anti-vaxxers. He discusses the development of new vaccines in the twentieth century, including those protecting against polio and MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), and the debunked paper that linked the MMR vaccine to autism; the CDC conspiracy theory promoted in the documentary Vaxxed; recommendations for an alternative vaccination schedule; Kennedy's misinformed campaign against thimerosal; and the much-abused religious exemption to vaccination.Anti-vaxxers have changed their minds, but rarely because someone has given them a list of facts. Berman argues that anti-vaccination activism is tied closely to how people see themselves as parents and community members. Effective pro-vaccination efforts should emphasize these cultural aspects rather than battling social media posts.},

The article studies three websites that present racist humour and display sympathies with the Ku Klux Klan. The analysis emphasizes the importance of examining the `metadiscourse', which presents and justifies the humour, as much as studying the nature of the humour itself. The meta-discourse of the sites' disclaimers is studied in relation to the justification of a joke being `just a joke'. It is shown that the extreme racist humour of the KKK is not just a joke, even in terms of its own meta-discourse of presentation. The meta-discourse also suggests that the extreme language of racist hatred is indicated a matter for enjoyment. The sites portray the imagining of extreme racist violence as a matter of humour and the ambivalence of their disclaimers is discussed. As such, it is suggested that there are integral links between extreme hatred and dehumanizing, violent humour.},

The ease and `viral' nature of social media sharing further complicate the situation. This paper provides a quick overview of the magnitude of the problem of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, its devastating effects, and its intricate relation to digital health literacy. The main strategies, methods and services that can be used to detect and prevent the spread of COVID-19 misinformation, including machine learning-based approaches, health literacy guidelines, checklists, mythbusters and fact-checkers, are then briefly reviewed. Given the complexity of the COVID-19 infodemic, it is very unlikely that any of these approaches or tools will be fully effective alone in stopping the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Instead, a mixed, synergistic approach, combining the best of these strategies, methods, and services together, is highly recommended in tackling online health misinformation, and mitigating its negative effects in COVID-19 and future pandemics. Furthermore, techniques and tools should ideally focus on evaluating both the message (information content) and the messenger (information author/source) and not just rely on assessing the latter as a quick and easy proxy for the trustworthiness and truthfulness of the former. Surveying and improving population digital health literacy levels are also essential for future infodemic preparedness.},

While traditional journalistic media has tried to adapt to the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the Internet have given the events their own ideological spin. Such voices have been criticized for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially dangerous "fake news" or conspiracy theories via social media and other online channels. The current study analyzes the factual basis of such fears in an initial computational content analysis of alternative news media's output on Facebook during the early Corona crisis, based on a large German data set from January to the second half of March 2020. Using computational content analysis, methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined, as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in this analysis.},

The aim of this conference was to investigate platform-driven changes and emerging practices of everyday-life content production occurring ``below the radar'' of internet research, or outside of previous standards of data visibility and accessibility on which most internet studies have been based over the last decade. In the current context, online spaces seem to be heading toward more circumscribed and unsteady forms of publicness, which contrast with the platform affordances upon which the theorization of networked publics has been built. Private groups, locked platforms, and ephemeral contents are some of the challenges that require the development of new perspectives and research tools capable of adapting to this shifting environment. In this introduction, we will illustrate how the theme of ``below the radar'' has evolved since the initial call thanks to the confrontation with the researchers who participated in the conference, and this special issue, and we will introduce the nine articles that make up the collection. These articles, which combine different research disciplines and techniques, provide a map of some of the most urgent theoretical, ethical, and methodological issues concerning the current transformations of the visibility regimes of online social action.},

In this paper, we highlight the pervasiveness of metaphor in incel communication, so far unaddressed in the budding studies of incel language. Specifically, using a sample of circa 22,500 words from the banned incel Reddit forum r/Braincels, we focus on how members of this community use metaphoric expressions to dehumanise gendered social actors, both as individuals and as groups. We discuss our findings against the backdrop of metaphor approaches to language, gender, and sexuality, and the relevance of dehumanising metaphorical rhetoric for online misogynist groups.},

This article presents a new approach to tackle this stance detection problem, based on the combination of string similarity features with a deep neural architecture that leverages ideas previously advanced in the context of learning efficient text representations, document classification, and natural language inference.

We also explore the use of external sources of information, specifically large datasets of sentence pairs originally proposed for training and evaluating natural language inference methods, in order to pre-train specific components of the neural network architecture (e.g., the RNNs used for encoding sentences). The obtained results attest to the effectiveness of the proposed ideas and show that our model, particularly when considering pre-training and the combination of neural representations together with similarity features, slightly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.},

  publisher = {Routledge},
  abstract = {Networked publics must be understood in terms of ``publics,'' a contested and  messy term with multiple meanings that is used across different disciplines to  signal different concepts. One approach is to construct ``public'' as a collection  of people who share ``a common understanding of the world, a shared identity,  a claim to inclusiveness, a consensus regarding the collective interest'' (Livingstone, 2005, p. 9). In this sense, a public may refer to a local collection of  people (e.g., one's peers) or a much broader collection of people (e.g.,  members of a nation-state). Those invested in the civic functioning of publics  often concern themselves with the potential accessibility of spaces and  information to wide audiences-``the public''---and the creation of a shared  ``public sphere'' (Habermas, 1991). Yet, as Benedict Anderson (2006) argues,  the notion of a public is in many ways an ``imagined community.'' Some scholars contend that there is no single public, but many publics to which some  people are included and others excluded (Warner, 2002).  Cultural and media studies offer a different perspective on the notion of  what constitutes a public. In locating the term ``public'' as synonymous with  ``audience,'' Sonia Livingstone (2005) uses the term to refer to a group  bounded by a shared text, whether a worldview or a performance. The audience produced by media is often by its very nature a public, but not necessarily a passive one. For example, Michel de Certeau (2002) argues that  consumption and production of cultural objects are intimately connected, and  Henry Jenkins (2006) applies these ideas to the creation and dissemination of  media. Mizuko Ito extends this line of thinking to argue that ``publics can bereactors, (re)makers and (re)distributors, engaging in shared culture and  knowledge through discourse and social exchange as well as through acts of  media reception'' (Ito, 2008, p. 3).  It is precisely this use of public that upsets political theorists like Jurgen Habermas, who challenge the legitimacy of any depoliticized public preoccupied ``with  consumption of culture'' (Habermas, 1991, p. 177). Of course, not all political  scholars agree with Habermas' objection to the cultural significance of publics.  Feminist scholar Nancy Fraser argues that publics are not only a site of discourse  and opinion but ``arenas for the formation and enactment of social identities''  (Fraser, 1992), while Craig Calhoun argues that one of Habermas' weaknesses is  his naive view that ``identities and interests [are] settled within the private world  and then brought fully formed into the public sphere'' (Calhoun, 1992, p. 35).  Networked publics exist against this backdrop. Mizuko Ito introduces the  notion of networked publics to ``reference a linked set of social, cultural, and  technological developments that have accompanied the growing engagement  with digitally networked media'' (Ito, 2008, p. 2). Ito emphasizes the networked media, but I believe we must also focus on the ways in which this  shapes publics-both in terms of space and collectives. In short, I contend that  networked publics are publics that are restructured by networked technologies; they are simultaneously a space and a collection of people.  In bringing forth the notion of networked publics, I am not seeking to  resolve the different discursive threads around the notion of publics. My  approach accepts the messiness and, instead, focuses on the ways in which networked technologies extend and complicate publics in all of their forms. What  distinguishes networked publics from other types of publics is their underlying  structure. Networked technologies reorganize how information flows and how  people interact with information and each other. In essence, the architecture of  networked publics differentiates them from more traditional notions of publics.},

During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, Facebook-the world's largest social media company-began to remove vaccine misinformation as a matter of policy. We evaluated the efficacy of these policies using a comparative interrupted time-series design. We found that Facebook removed some antivaccine content, but we did not observe decreases in overall engagement with antivaccine content. Provaccine content was also removed, and antivaccine content became more misinformative, more politically polarized, and more likely to be seen in users' newsfeeds. We explain these findings as a consequence of Facebook's system architecture, which provides substantial flexibility to motivated users who wish to disseminate misinformation through multiple channels. Facebook's architecture may therefore afford antivaccine content producers several means to circumvent the intent of misinformation removal policies.},

Contrary to expectations, websites promoted in pro-vaccine venues are more monetized than those promoted in anti-vaccine venues. This is a consequence of the heavy monetization of news websites -- pro-vaccine venues are roughly 1.7 times more likely to share links to news. The specific news sites shared by anti-vaccine venues are rated less credible by fact-checking organizations, but we find no significant differences in monetization. However, non-news sites, such as blogs, shared by anti-vaccine actors were significantly more monetized. These results emphasize the need to interpret measures of monetization within the context of the broader "attention economy."},

  abstract = {This article explores the new modalities of visibility engendered by new media, with a focus on the social networking site Facebook. Influenced by Foucault's writings on Panopticism -- that is, the architectural structuring of visibility -- this article argues for understanding the construction of visibility on Facebook through an architectural framework that pays particular attention to underlying software processes and algorithmic power. Through an analysis of EdgeRank, the algorithm structuring the flow of information and communication on Facebook's `News Feed', I argue that the regime of visibility constructed imposes a perceived `threat of invisibility' on the part of the participatory subject. As a result, I reverse Foucault's notion of surveillance as a form of permanent visibility, arguing that participatory subjectivity is not constituted through the imposed threat of an all-seeing vision machine, but by the constant possibility of disappearing and becoming obsolete.},

  abstract = {Abstract Soon after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world saw far-right leaders uniting to promote hydroxychloroquine despite controversial results. Why have some leaders actively promoted the drug since then, contradicting recommendations made by their own government's health authorities? Our argument is twofold. First, hydroxychloroquine has been an integral tool of medical populist performance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We adopt Lasco \& Curato's (2018) definition of medical populism as a political style based on performances of public health crises that pit `the people' against `the establishment' using alternative knowledge claims to cast doubt on the credibility of doctors, scientists, and technocrats. Second, rather than being an individual endeavor, medical populism addressing the coronavirus crisis has led populists to build an alt-science network. We define it as a loose movement of alleged truth-seekers who publicly advance scientific claims at a crossroads between partial evidence, pseudo-science, and conspiracy theories. It comprises scientists, businesspeople and celebrities united by their distrust of governments and mainstream science. In this article, we look at how the hydroxychloroquine alliance was formed, as well as its political and policy implications. To this end, we compare why and how Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro have appealed to medical populist performances when addressing the health crisis. By mobilizing the concepts of medical populism and alt-science, this paper aims to contribute to the scholarship on the relationship between populist politics and policy-making.           ,              Resumo Logo ap{\'o}s a eclos{\~a}o da pandemia da COVID-19, o mundo viu l{\'i}deres de extrema direita se unindo para promover a hidroxicloroquina (HCQ), apesar de resultados controversos. Por que alguns l{\'i}deres promoveram ativamente o rem{\'e}dio desde ent{\~a}o, mesmo contradizendo recomenda{\c c}{\~o}es de autoridades de sa{\'u}de de seus pr{\'o}prios governos? Nosso argumento {\'e} duplo. Primeiro, a HCQ tem sido uma ferramenta integral do desempenho m{\'e}dico populista no contexto da pandemia de COVID-19. Adotamos a defini{\c c}{\~a}o de Lasco e Curato (2018) de populismo m{\'e}dico como um estilo pol{\'i}tico perform{\'a}tico durante crises de sa{\'u}de p{\'u}blica que joga ``o povo'' contra ``o sistema'' usando alega{\c c}{\~o}es de conhecimento alternativo para lan{\c c}ar d{\'u}vidas sobre a credibilidade de m{\'e}dicos, cientistas e tecnocratas. Segundo, em vez de ser um esfor{\c c}o individual, o populismo m{\'e}dico diante da crise do coronav{\'i}rus levou populistas a construir uma rede de ci{\^e}ncia alternativa, definida como um movimento difuso de supostos buscadores da verdade que defendem publicamente suas convic{\c c}{\~o}es cient{\'i}ficas em uma encruzilhada entre evid{\^e}ncias parciais, pseudoci{\^e}ncia e teorias da conspira{\c c}{\~a}o. {\'E} composto por cientistas, empres{\'a}rios e celebridades unidos por sua desconfian{\c c}a nos governos e na ci{\^e}ncia convencional. Neste artigo, examinamos a forma{\c c}{\~a}o da alian{\c c}a da hidroxicloroquina, bem como suas implica{\c c}{\~o}es pol{\'i}ticas e para as pol{\'i}ticas p{\'u}blicas. Para tanto, comparamos por que e como Donald Trump e Jair Bolsonaro recorreram ao populismo m{\'e}dico perform{\'a}tico ao abordar a crise de sa{\'u}de. Ao mobilizar os conceitos de populismo m{\'e}dico e ci{\^e}ncia alternativa, este artigo tem como objetivo contribuir para o estudo da rela{\c c}{\~a}o entre pol{\'i}tica populista e formula{\c c}{\~a}o de pol{\'i}ticas.           ,              Resumen Poco despu{\'e}s del comienzo de la pandemia de COVID-19, el mundo vio a l{\'i}deres de ultraderecha uni{\'e}ndose para promover la hidroxicloroquina (HCQ) a pesar de sus controvertidos resultados. {\textquestiondown}Por qu{\'e} algunos l{\'i}deres han promocionado activamente la medicina desde entonces, incluso contradiciendo las recomendaciones de las autoridades de salud de sus propios gobiernos?

To this end, we developed a dataset of 1,500 messages labeled by experts according to three aspects: veracity level, potential for harm, and category. The labeling process achieved an agreement score of 81\%. Experiments were conducted using state-of-the-art algorithms such as XGBoost, a BERT-based classifier, and a GPT-based classifier. The models trained on the labeled dataset achieved an F1-Score of 0.83 for detecting falsehood and 0.92 for potential harm, indicating their effectiveness in identifying misinformation in this context.},

A seguir, recupera-se o debate do campo de estudos cr{\'i}ticos do humor, a respeito de piadas racistas e mis{\'o}ginas.

Although the term ``meme'' is commonly used nowadays to define a specific media content or language, its origin and the field of research it has been linked to try to answer questions that have long been the object of the social sciences. The present research is anchored in a perception that meme studies can be sorted in three generations, according to their latent concerns: ontological and epistemological debates, and a series of more recent applied studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent emergency authorization and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by regulatory bodies has generated global attention. As the most popular video-sharing platform globally, YouTube is a potent medium for the dissemination of key public health information. Understanding the nature of available content regarding COVID-19 vaccination on this widely used platform is of substantial public health interest. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and quality of information on COVID-19 vaccination in YouTube videos. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the phrases ``coronavirus vaccine'' and ``COVID-19 vaccine'' were searched on the UK version of YouTube on December 10, 2020. The 200 most viewed videos of each search were extracted and screened for relevance and English language. Video content and characteristics were extracted and independently rated against Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct and DISCERN quality criteria for consumer health information by 2 authors. Results: Forty-eight videos, with a combined total view count of 30,100,561, were included in the analysis. Topics addressed comprised the following: vaccine science (n=18, 58\%), vaccine trials (n=28, 58\%), side effects (n=23, 48\%), efficacy (n=17, 35\%), and manufacturing (n=8, 17\%). Ten (21\%) videos encouraged continued public health measures. Only 2 (4.2\%) videos made nonfactual claims. The content of 47 (98\%) videos was scored to have low (n=27, 56\%) or moderate (n=20, 42\%) adherence to Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct principles. Median overall DISCERN score per channel type ranged from 40.3 (IQR 34.8-47.0) to 64.3 (IQR 58.5-66.3). Educational channels produced by both medical and nonmedical professionals achieved significantly higher DISCERN scores than those of other categories. The highest median DISCERN scores were achieved by educational videos produced by medical professionals (64.3, IQR 58.5-66.3) and the lowest median scores by independent users (18, IQR 18-20). Conclusions: The overall quality and reliability of information on COVID-19 vaccines on YouTube remains poor. Videos produced by educational channels, especially by medical professionals, were higher in quality and reliability than those produced by other sources, including health-related organizations. Collaboration between health-related organizations and established medical and educational YouTube content producers provides an opportunity for the dissemination of high-quality information on COVID-19 vaccination. Such collaboration holds potential as a rapidly implementable public health intervention aiming to engage a wide audience and increase public vaccination awareness and knowledge.},

Four distinct methodological approaches are examined in particular detail, namely automated social information extraction, social network analysis, social complexity theory, and social simulation modeling. The coverage of each of these approaches is supported by a discussion of the historical context and motivations, as well as by a list of recommended texts for further reading.Topics and features: describes the scope and content of each area of CSS, covering topics on information extraction, social networks, complexity theory, and social simulations; highlights the main theories of the CSS paradigm as causal explanatory frameworks that shed new light on the nature of human and social dynamics; explains how to distinguish and analyze the different levels of analysis of social complexity using computational approaches; discusses a number of methodological tools, including extracting entities from text, computing social network indices, and building an agent-based model; presents the main classes of entities, objects, and relations common to the computational analysis of social complexity; examines the interdisciplinary integration of knowledge in the context of social phenomena.This unique, clearly-written textbook is essential reading for graduate and advanced undergraduate students planning on embarking on a course on computational social science, or wishing to refresh their knowledge of the fundamental aspects of this exciting field.},

Under the supervision of the national service of security, participants were ordered to psychologically weaken a person suspected of preparing an attack. We manipulated the ethnicity of the victim and his terrorist membership. The doubly stigmatized victim (i.e. a North African victim member of al Qaeda) was tortured more severely than the other victims. We found some evidence that this effect was mediated by a decrease in term of other-oriented empathy, but not by personal distress. These results suggest that an empathy alteration process underlies dehumanization in crimes of obedience perpetrated against members of extreme out-groups.},

The reason is that a market designed to monetize engagement with fringe audiences encourages actors to create content that can go viral, hence creating financial incentives to circulate controversial claims, adversarial narratives, and deceptive content. The theoretical claim of this piece is that the actors and practices of digital media platforms can be analyzed through their market practices. Through this lens, scholars can study whether digital markets such as programmatic advertising, commercial content moderation, and influencer marketing make money from circulating disinformation. To show how disinformation is an expected outcome, not breakage, of the current media market in digital platforms, the article analyzes the business models of pre-digital broadcasting media, partisan media, and digital media platforms, finding qualitatively different forms of disinformation in each media market iteration.},

This application works together with a Telegram bot whose function is to ask the players their attendance to the next match and save their responses. The bot must be in the Telegram group that the players use to communicate. For the proper functioning of both the application and bot, the bot will have to be added by the creator of the team in the application and input the id of the Telegram group through a written command, even though each user will also have to provide his own Telegram id given directly by the bot. Key words: Android, bot, Telegram, team, sport.},

  abstract = {Still without consensus, the term post-truth is closely related to fake news and the information discourse in a broad way, thus impacting our communication on the various digital devices. Considering argumentativeness, in its broad sense, as the foundation of all linguistic exchange, the study presents a perspective on the concept of post-truth and, from it, reflects on its consequences in the argumentative construction. Therefore, five texts are analyzed, of which three are related to the covid-19 pandemic, disseminated on different social networks in April 2020 and identified as ``Fake'' by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and two of them circulated in the television electoral during the election campaign for the presidency of Brazil, in October 2022. The analysis demonstrates the impact of the post-truth as an argumentative paradigm, inaugurating a pattern of non-persuasion favored by the exchange between equals. As linguistic-discursive consequences, the appeal to implicit (shared by the interlocutors) and the irrelevance of an argumentative rationality based on semantic logic are observed.},

Thirdly, we argue that during the pandemic both strategies were combined, thus producing socio-political phenomena that erode democracy, such as the trivialization of deaths and the naturalization of the cleavage between valuable lives, less valuable lives, and disposable lives.},

It deals with three different forms of radicalisation, including Islamist radicalisation, right-wing as well as left-wing radicalisation. In addition, an overview is provided of current academic debates regarding the role of the internet in radicalisation processes. The review is intended to help social scientists who are entering the field of radicalisation studies navigate through the complexity of underlying processes and factors that lead different individuals or groups to adopt radical ideas and commit acts of violence. The review is particularly relevant for countries of Central and Eastern Europe where radicalisation remains understudied, although most countries in the region share histories of extremism and political radicalism.}

  abstract = {A sizable literature tracing back to Richard Hofstadter's The Paranoid Style (1964) argues that Republicans and conservatives are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than Democrats and liberals. However, the evidence for this proposition is mixed. Since conspiracy theory beliefs are associated with dangerous orientations and behaviors, it is imperative that social scientists better understand the connection between conspiracy theories and political orientations. Employing 20 surveys of Americans from 2012 to 2021 (total n\,=\,37,776), as well as surveys of 20 additional countries spanning six continents (total n\,=\,26,416), we undertake an expansive investigation of the asymmetry thesis. First, we examine the relationship between beliefs in 52 conspiracy theories and both partisanship and ideology in the U.S.; this analysis is buttressed by an examination of beliefs in 11 conspiracy theories across 20 more countries. In our second test, we hold constant the content of the conspiracy theories investigated---manipulating only the partisanship of the theorized villains---to decipher whether those on the left or right are more likely to accuse political out-groups of conspiring. Finally, we inspect correlations between political orientations and the general predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories over the span of a decade. In no instance do we observe systematic evidence of a political asymmetry. Instead, the strength and direction of the relationship between political orientations and conspiricism is dependent on the characteristics of the specific conspiracy beliefs employed by researchers and the socio-political context in which those ideas are considered.},

  abstract = {Populism continues to gain traction in politics but there has been relatively little research on how it plays out on the Internet. The special issue at hand aims at narrowing this gap of research by focusing on the close relation between populism and online communication. This introduction presents an integrative definition of populism, as well as a theoretical analysis of the interplay between populist communication logic and online opportunity structures. The individual contributions discuss how populist actors may benefit from the Internet. They analyze how political leaders and extreme parties use populist online communication. The authors also shed light on how populist movements may relate to various political parties. They finally demonstrate which groups of social media users are more susceptible to populism than others and what effects populist online communication may have on citizens. We hope that this special issue will contribute to the discussion on what is arguably one of the largest political challenges currently faced by a series of nations around the globe.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the Russian Internet has developed according to strong centralizing and State-controlling tendencies, both in terms of legal instruments and technical infrastructure. This strategy implies a strong push to develop Russian-made technical solutions for censorship and traffic interception. Thus, a promising market has opened for Russian vendors of software and hardware solutions for traffic surveillance and filtering. Drawing from a mixed-methods approach and perspectives grounded primarily in Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies and the political economy of information networks, this paper aims at exploring the flourishing sector of Russian industry of censorship and surveillance. We focus on two kinds of ``black boxes'' and examine their influence on the market of Internet Service Providers: surveillance systems known as SORM (System for Operative Investigative Activities), and traffic filtering solutions used to block access to websites that have been blacklisted by Roskomnadzor, the Russian federal watchdog for media and telecommunications. This research sheds light on the vivid debates around controversial technologies which Internet actors must adopt in order to avoid government fines, but which are expensive and complex to implement and raise a number of ethical and political concerns.},

This article analyzes the ``Telegram ban'' and its ramifications, understanding it as a socio-technical controversy that unveils the tensions between the governmental narrative of a ``sovereign Internet'' and multiple infrastructure-based battles of resistance, critique and circumvention. We show how, in the context of a Russian Internet which is heavily entwined with and dependent from foreign and global infrastructures, a number of bottom-up, infrastructure-based digital resistances are able to emerge and thrive despite the strategy of effective centralised management that the Russian government seeks to present to the world as its own.},

Disinformation can cause significant harm if people are misled by it. In order to address this critical threat to information quality, we first need to understand exactly what disinformation is. This paper surveys the various analyses of this concept that have been proposed by information scientists and philosophers (most notably, Luciano Floridi). It argues that these analyses are either too broad (that is, that they include things that are not disinformation), or too narrow (they exclude things that are disinformation), or both. Indeed, several of these analyses exclude important forms of disinformation, such as true disinformation, visual disinformation, side-effect disinformation, and adaptive disinformation. After considering the shortcomings of these analyses, the paper argues that disinformation is misleading information that has the function of misleading. Finally, in addition to responding to Floridi's claim that such a precise analysis of disinformation is not necessary, it briefly discusses how this analysis can help us develop techniques for detecting disinformation and policies for deterring its spread.},

This paper explores a case study based on 4876 unique posts from one Irish-based Telegram group active during six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main findings are that: (a) this group was heavily influenced by foreign content and influencers, in particular, American ERW content and conspiracies associated with QAnon; (b) conspiracy theories were not adopted wholesale but adapted for an Irish audience; (c) Irish actors were not passive receivers of US content, and multi-directional exchanges of ideas were witnessed. While generalising beyond the case study analysed in this paper would require further data, this may suggest that Irish influencers are part of a transnational online ecosystem in which ideas and theories are shared and adapted to local contexts. These findings offer insights into the ERW in Ireland and, more generally, how the ERW communicates and spread conspiracy theories across national borders.},

Results revealed a prevalence of positive emotions such as contentment, enthusiasm, and interest regarding the vaccines, especially in videos of a personal and informative character. Negative emotions, such as doubt and disapproval, were associated with contextual and strategic factors, with significant expression in humorous and infotainment publications.},

  abstract = {This paper takes up the assumption that social media offers a beneficial terrain for the far right to undermine open societies. Identifying perceptions of imperilment as the central impetus for the far right to justify illiberal politics, it analyzes how such perceptions are boosted under the digital condition. This contextualization is essential for our understanding of digital fascism: a highly fluid and ambivalent variant of fascism that lacks a clear organizational center as the digitally networked masses are the engine of their own manipulation. To substantiate this concept, we relate structures of social media to far-right agency in social media. Concretely, we show how the techniques of dramatic storytelling, gaslighting and metric manipulation correspond with the functioning of social media that catalyzes the amplification of fears, the diffusion of post-truth and the logic of numbers. Based on this, we argue that a new perspective on fascism is needed, since digital fascism draws its dynamics mainly from digital (hate) cultures and less from formal and regimented party structures. In consequence, it has to be analyzed and countered as a social phenomenon that emerges both organically and strategically in the ecosystems of social media. This presents open societies with a dilemma: The dynamics of digital fascism develop out of structures that warrant freedom of expression -- and to break these dynamics, restrictions that harm its liberal principles appear necessary.},

  abstract = {This article discusses Conspiracy Theories in Brazil, understood as one of the various forms of disinformation that make up the contemporary information disorder. Two movements were carried out with the intent to understand and characterize them in terms of form and content: a critical review of the literature, which sought to emphasize national authors, and systematic observation and collection of messages from two Telegram groups. These made possible to it to identify the prevalence of content that, although establishing alternative epistemologies, does not challenge the Modern scientific paradigm. Four rhetorical mechanisms stood out: circularity, suppressed nucleation, Manichaeism and the use of concurrent and simultaneous indeterminacies. CTs provide security and control to those who adhere to them, both due to the logical simplicity of the proposed reasoning (based on linear causalities) and to the increase in their appreciation and social belonging by other conspiracists. This gives TCs great potential for engaging and mobilizing social groups effectively weakened by current structures and also those who consider themselves disadvantaged due to the loss of privileges to which they were accustomed.},

Strong pillars of belief among the QAnon movement, coupled with the spread of disinformation online, has exacerbated the familiarity and willingness to accept the rhetoric within mainstream media and culture. This report examines the evolution, ideologies, and paradigms associated with supporters of QAnon to better understand the most influential mechanisms of modern conspiracy-based radicalization. Utilizing a France-based digital disinformation platform known as Storyzy, the authors hypothesize that disinformation campaigns, coupled with the Internet and social media, has greatly enabled the unprecedented global effect of QAnon. The authors explored the potential of several survey methods to seek insights from QAnon followers on Gab and Telegram. Additionally, the authors discerned various implications of QAnon in regard to the limitations placed upon P/CVE efforts.~Editoral Note:After critique against this article has been voiced publicly, an editorial review together with the authors was conducted. No factual errors were found.

  abstract = {Background: Distanceeducation for mothers with suckling babies can have a high effect and more proponents due to short time of such mothers as well as other problems like bringing infant with themselves. Authors of this research have shared an experience on application of social network of Telegram for educational intervention in field of continued breast feeding and complementary feeding of children among Iranian women. Materials and Methods: In this research, social network of Telegram was employed to provide teachings associated with continued breastfeeding and complementary feeding of children to mothers based on the model of Center for Diseases Control of USA (CDC). 90 members, out of 125 mothers who were informed, became member of Telegram group voluntary with informed consent,namely that the participation rate was 72\%. The Telegram group called "Mother's love - Mother's milk" was designed on August 2016 and has been active for 6 months until this date. The group has been active under the management of an experienced physician and consultation with a pharmacist. Results: Participants of this research reported cell phone, internet, physician, books, and journals as the most-used sources, respectively, to access to information about breast feeding and health of their children. Only five mother of group-member mothers were uneducated or had elementary education level. Also, it was determined that the higher percentage of women who joined Telegram group were housewives compared with the group who had no tendency to join group. 100\% of members evaluated membership in Telegram group and subjects related to complementary feeding beneficial and 39 of 41 (95\%) participants in an E-survey, were satisfied with learning, and 35 members (85.4\%) were satisfied with teaching. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of social networks as potential educational field. Usage of this media, particularly among women groups under specific circumstance of pregnancy, can be beneficial.},

  abstract = {High uptake of vaccinations is essential in fighting infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Social media play a crucial role in propagating misinformation about vaccination, including through conspiracy theories and can negatively impact trust in vaccination. Users typically engage with multiple social media platforms; however, little is known about the role and content of cross-platform use in spreading vaccination-related information. This study examined the content and dynamics of YouTube videos shared in vaccine-related tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations before the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. We screened approximately 144 million tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations and identified 930,539 unique tweets in English that discussed vaccinations posted between 1 February and 23 June 2020. We then identified links to 2,097 unique YouTube videos that were tweeted. Analysis of the video transcripts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling and independent coders indicate the dominance of conspiracy theories. Following the World Health Organization's declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, anti-vaccination frames rapidly transitioned from claiming that vaccines cause autism to pandemic conspiracy theories, often featuring Bill Gates. Content analysis of the 20 most tweeted videos revealed that the majority (n~=~15) opposed vaccination and included conspiracy theories. Their spread on Twitter was consistent with spamming and coordinated efforts. These findings show the role of cross-platform sharing of YouTube videos over Twitter as a strategy to propagate primarily anti-vaccination messages. Future policies and interventions should consider how to counteract misinformation spread via such cross-platform activities.},

We discuss the mis-/disinformation as a significant challenge to the public health, intelligence, and policymaking communities and highlight the necessity to design measures enabling the prevention, interdiction, and mitigation of such threats. We then present an overview of selected opportunities for applying technology to study and combat disinformation, outlining several approaches currently being used to understand, describe, and model the phenomena of misinformation and disinformation. We focus specifically on complex networks, machine learning, data- and text-mining methods in misinformation detection, sentiment analysis, and agent-based models of misinformation spreading and the detection of misinformation sources in the network. We conclude with the set of recommendations supporting the World Health Organization's initiative on infodemiology. We support the implementation of integrated preventive procedures and internationalization of infodemic management. We also endorse the application of the cross-disciplinary methodology of Crime Science discipline, supplemented by Big Data analysis and related information technologies to prevent, disrupt, and detect mis- and disinformation efficiently.},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods---they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

BERTopic generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

He shows that Trump's manic nonsense is actually a continuation, the result of a long struggle between the new right and the reactionary right. What is new, he adds, is that the reactionary right has been legitimated--and has brought its political strategy of sowing chaos into the heart of mainstream politics. The author also analyzes the national mood--explaining how that plays out in the actions of both Trump supporters and opponents--and lays out a possible nightmare future: a vision of a political system controlled by corporate interests, built on a deliberate dismantling of modern politics},

  abstract = {In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vocal protest scene emerged in Germany. Comparisons to Nazi-Germany, conspiracy topoi, and antisemitic narratives were its prominent companions -- on the streets as well as on social media. One former vegan chef and b-lister became a well-known agitator, culminating in multiple threats to people in public life and blatant, Holocaust-denying antisemitism. This chapter analyzes the development of Attila Hildmann's conspiracist and antisemitic escalation toward a ``superconspiracy'' (Barkun) using a mixed-methods approach. This antisemitic escalation begins with conspiracist narratives and a personalized concept of enemy (predominantly Bill Gates) and moves through prevalent conspiracist themes with antisemitic implications to outright promotion of violence. In the process, implicitly antisemitic references are replaced with open antisemitism. The results confirm that video hosting services and the messenger Telegram are not only important for mobilizing protests, but are also an important resource for analyzing antisemitism in its various forms. This work also proves that a combination of a hermeneutical approach and frequency analysis on multiple platforms is useful for analyzing enormous amounts of diverse data, and for contextualizing the characteristics of narrative structures of conspiracy beliefs.},

To explore this worrisome phenomenon, this study aims to investigate the effects of political misinformation by integrating three theoretical approaches: (1) misinformation, (2) polarization, and (3) selective exposure. In this article, we examine the role of fact-checkers in discrediting polarized misinformation in a fragmented media environment. We rely on two experiments (N = 1,117) in which we vary exposure to attitudinal-congruent or incongruent political news and a follow-up fact-check article debunking the information. Participants were either forced to see or free to select a fact-checker. Results show that fact-checkers can be successful as they (1) lower agreement with attitudinally congruent political misinformation and (2) can overcome political polarization. Moreover, dependent on the issue, fact-checkers are most likely to be selected when they confirm prior attitudes and avoided when they are incongruent, indicating a confirmation bias for selecting corrective information. The freedom to select or avoid fact-checkers does not have an impact on political beliefs.},

In this paper, we tried to study the messages of the Farsi-speaking users of the Telegram communication network from the linguistics perspective. In this regard, the linguistics and rhetorical correspondence of short messages in Persian language was studied by the content-analysis method. The statistical population consisted of 150 messages which contained 327 sentences. These messages were randomly selected from 5 different groups. Persian language used in cyberspace differs from standard Persian language. The first step in correcting communication language errors in cyberspace is to inform the users about the type of errors.},

  author = {Heinrich, Abra},
  year = {2022},
  urldate = {2022-06-01},
  abstract = {Recently, ecofascism, a radical environmentalist ideology often associated with (Neo-)Nazis, has regained popular interest following several right-wing extremist terrorist attacks  (Christchurch (2019) and El Paso (2019)) after which the attackers cited the ideology as a motivation. In both cases, online platforms played a role as sources of radical ideas, and in general, there is an established link between extremist online forums and offline violence. Given the renewed relevance of ecofascism as a motivator for violence, this thesis aims to understand how ecofascist groups of the far-right achieve emotional resonance with their audience by using a centuries-old ideology. The aim is to contribute towards an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ecofascist thought that explain its appeal and ability to motivate violence. To address this question, this thesis will conduct a qualitative case study analysis on far-right environmentalist Telegram channels using a   snowballing sampling method. In order to identify relevant content, this thesis will operationalize the far-right ecologism (FRE) framework. The FRE framework will also be used to code the sample according to an interpretative theme. Additionally, frame analysis, and the sensitizing concepts of emotional resonance and contextual shifts are used to address how an interplay of framings, appeals to emotions, and a global context characterized by environmental crises may contribute towards the resonance of ecofascist content. The thesis concludes that an important component of the emotional resonance of far-right ecologist content is the way posts not only associate nature with white supremacist ideology, but also how they connect these themes to a global, changing context characterized by environmental crises. This interplay of ideas aims to create a larger, emotional impact on their audience. The relevance of this insight is that the strategic use of themes of environmental crises by the far-right might serve as a new entry point to extremist ideologies and aid the recruitment of new members, especially those already concerned over environmental degradation.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to analyze the sources, characteristics, tone, and content of the most viewed YouTube videos in Spanish about Covid-19 vaccines. In February 2021, a search was carried out on YouTube using the terms ``Vacuna Covid,'' ``Vacuna coronavirus,'' and ``Vacuna Covid19.'' Associations between tone, source, and others variables (e.g. number of views or dislikes) were studied with a Mann--Whitney U-test and a chi-square test. A total of 118 videos were analyzed; 63.6\% were originated from Mexico and the USA; media created 57.6\% of the videos. Positive tone was observed in 53.4\%. The most discussed topics were target groups for vaccination (38.9\%) and safety (43.2\%). The 68 videos produced by media accumulated 31,565,295 views (55.0\% of views), and the 19 videos created by health professionals obtained 10,742,825 views (18.7\% of views). A significantly smaller number of likes was obtained in videos of media compared to those created by health professionals (p =~.004). Videos made by health professionals, compared to those of media, showed a greater positive tone (OR~=~3.09). Hoaxes/conspiracy theories were identified in 1.7\% of the videos. Monitoring that the information on YouTube about Covid-19 vaccines is reliable should be a central part of Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.},

  abstract = {Sociological interest in vaccination has recently increased, largely in response to media coverage of concerns over the safety of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. The resulting body of research highlights the importance of risk and trust in understanding parental and professional engagement with vaccination. To date, only limited attention has been paid to organised parental groups that campaign against aspects of vaccination policy. This paper reports findings from a qualitative study of contemporary groups in the UK, and develops three main lines of argument. First, these actors are best analysed as `Vaccine Critical groups' and include Radical and Reformist types. Second, Vaccine Critical groups discursively resist vaccination through a reframing that constructs risk as unknown and non-random. Third, trust as faith is negatively contrasted with the empowerment that is promised to result from taking personal responsibility for health and decision-making. Whilst representing a challenge to aspects of vaccination policy, this study confirms that the groups are involved in the articulation and promotion of other dominant discourses. These findings have implications for wider sociological debates about risk and trust in relation to health.},

These two fields are finding increasing importance in law enforcement and the investigation of cybercrime as the ubiquity of personal computing and the internet becomes ever-more apparent. Digital forensics involves investigating computer systems and digital artefacts in general, while multimedia forensics is a sub-topic of digital forensics focusing on evidence extracted from both normal computer systems and special multimedia devices, such as digital cameras. This book focuses on the interface between digital forensics and multimedia forensics, bringing two closely related fields of forensic expertise together to identify and understand the current state-of-the-art in digital forensic investigation. Both fields are expertly attended to by contributions from researchers and forensic practitioners specializing in diverse topics such as forensic authentication, forensic triage, forensic photogrammetry, biometric forensics, multimedia device identification, and image forgery detection among many others.Key features:  Brings digital and multimedia forensics together with contributions from academia, law enforcement, and the digital forensics industry for extensive coverage of all the major aspects of digital forensics of multimedia data and devices Provides comprehensive and authoritative coverage of digital forensics of multimedia data and devices Offers not only explanations of techniques but also real-world and simulated case studies to illustrate how digital and multimedia forensics techniques work Includes a companion website hosting continually updated supplementary materials ranging from extended and updated coverage of standards to best practice guides, test datasets and more case studies},

Previous work suggests that, within mainstream platforms, community-level moderation is effective in mitigating the harm caused by the moderated communities. It is, however, unclear whether these results also hold when considering the broader Web ecosystem. Do toxic communities continue to grow in terms of user base and activity on their new platforms? Do their members become more toxic and ideologically radicalized? In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale observational study of how problematic online communities progress following community-level moderation measures. We analyze data from r/The\_Donald\vphantom\{\} and r/Incels, two communities that were banned from Reddit and subsequently migrated to their own standalone websites. Our results suggest that, in both cases, moderation measures significantly decreased posting activity on the new platform, reducing the number of posts, active users, and newcomers. In spite of that, users in one of the studied communities (r/The\_Donald) showed increases in signals associated with toxicity and radicalization, which justifies concerns that the reduction in activity may come at the expense of a more toxic and radical community. Overall, our results paint a nuanced portrait of the consequences of community-level moderation and can inform their design and deployment.}

  abstract = {Online messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord, each with hundreds of millions of users, are one of the dominant modes of communicating or interacting with one another. Despite the widespread use of public group chats, there exists no systematic or detailed characterization of these group chats. There is, more importantly, lack of a general understanding of how these (public) groups differ in characteristics and use across the different platforms. We also do not know whether the messaging platforms expose personally identifiable information, and we lack a comprehensive view of the privacy implications of leaks for the users. In this work, we address these gaps by analyzing the messaging platforms' ecosystem through the lens of a popular social media platform---Twitter. We search for WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord group URLs posted on Twitter over a period of 38 days and amass a set of 351K unique group URLs. We analyze the content accompanied by group URLs on Twitter, finding interesting differences related to the topics of the groups across the multiple messaging platforms. By monitoring the characteristics of these groups, every day for more than a month, and, furthermore, by joining a subset of 616 groups across the different messaging platforms, we share key insights into the discovery of these groups via Twitter and reveal how these groups change over time. Finally, we analyze whether messaging platforms expose personally identifiable information. In this paper, we show that (a) Twitter is a rich source for discovering public groups in the different messaging platforms, (b) group URLs from messaging platforms are ephemeral, and (c) the considered messaging platforms expose personally identifiable information, with such leaks being more prevalent on WhatsApp than on Telegram and Discord.},

These two phenomena, it argues, are not opposites but rather complements; crises are not accidental to a culture focused on safety, they are its raison d'{\^e}tre. Mapping out the temporality of networks, it argues that crises are new media's critical difference: its exception and its norm. Although crises promise to disrupt memory ? to disturb the usual programmability of our machines by indexing ?real time? ? they reinforce codes and coded logic: both codes and crises are central to the production of mythical and mystical sovereign subjects who weld together norm with reality, word with action. Codes and states of exception are complementary functions, which render information and ourselves undead. Against this fantasy and against the exhaustion that crisis as norm produces, the article ends by arguing that we need a means to exhaust exhaustion, to recover the undecidable potential of our decisions and our information through a practice of constant care.},

The aim of this study was to explore how Telegrams could be used in teaching and learning process. This study involved a case study approach where 31 students were the participants in the post graduate courses "Science Education and Human Development". Data were collected by Telegram discussion. This study found that several techniques can be carried out using Telegram: attendance, one way discussions, technique 1-2-3 discussion, pictures, drawing, and audio. Students responded that the teaching and learning using Telegram allow them to gain new experience, be more creative, generate spontaneous ideas, provide authentic ideas without the risk of being humiliated and encourage them to be excited as well as passionate with their learning. Compared with normal classes, all students can give ideas and the ideas were honest by themselves. This study implies that the latest innovation could solve the teaching according to the problems faced by teachers.~Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License},

To help interpret the patterns in the data, two novel conceptual innovations are introduced. The concept of `minion accounts' captures how following a de-platforming intervention, a series of secondary accounts are set up to continue the mission. Such accounts are part of a wider retinue of `re-platforming' behaviours. Overall, the empirical evidence reviewed suggests that whilst de-platforming can constrain transmission of conspiratorial disinformation, it does not eradicate it.},

  abstract = {This article explores how digital communications platforms are used in the aftermath of terrorist attacks to amplify or constrain the wider social impacts and consequences of politically motivated violence. Informed by empirical data collected by monitoring social media platforms following four terrorist attacks in the UK in 2017, the analysis focusses on the role of `soft facts' (rumours/conspiracy theories/fake news/propaganda) in influencing public understandings and definitions of the situation. Specifically, it identifies three digital influence engineering techniques -- spoofing, truthing and social proofing -- that are associated with the communication of misinformation and disinformation. After configuring these concepts, the authors consider their implications for policy and practice development, concluding that, to date, possibilities for evidence-informed post-event preventative interventions have been relatively neglected in the formulation of counter-terrorism strategies. They recommend more attention be paid to how strategic communications interventions can counteract the effects of misinformation and disinformation, and thus mitigate the wider public harms induced by terror events.},

Bisnis online umumnya dikenal sebagai perdagangan elektronik dan sekarang berubah menjadi jalan prinsip virtual dunia. Hal ini pada dasarnya menutupi semua kegiatan di web dan mendorong pelanggan untuk membeli item melalui internet. Dalam situasi yang cepat berubah dalam e-bisnis, pelanggan memiliki banyak permintaan, mereka mencari strategi pertukaran dengan cara sederhana dan berguna. Dengan mengamati dan mendobrak perilaku dan persyaratan pelanggan online, mereka mengharapkan penawaran termurah dan pelayanan tercepat. Ini adalah permintaan yang penting setiap pelanggan yang akan menggunakan e-commerce.   Menurut Jakob Bjerre (2015) Telegram messenger menggunakan teknik enkripsi dan memiliki keamanan yang tinggi karena menyediakan keamanan lebih dari setiap aplikasi untuk keamanan, privasi, dan cepat.cepat, dan Penerima Anda mendapat data secepat Anda mengklik tombol kirim. Gratis,sumber terbuka, dan aman, membuat Telegram mudah digunakan untuk pengembang aplikasi yang ingin memodifikasi kode sumber Telegram Messenger. Dengan menggunakan Bot oleh Telegram Messenger pengembang bisa aplikasi dibangun atas Telegram dan mempersembahkan jemaat itu kepada pengguna Telegram. Oleh itu e-commerce sistem dapat menggunakan keuntungan dari Telegram bot untuk desain dan implementasi sistem e-commerce yang lebih efisien untuk pengguna. In the recent years, the internet has made another capacity called e- commerce web based business. Online business is generally known as electronic trade and now as turn into a virtual principle road of the world. It is basically cover all activities on the web and prompts the customer to buy the item over the internet. In the quickly changing situation of e-business, customers have turned out to be additionally requesting; they are searching for strategies by which exchange should be possible in a simple and helpful way. By watching and breaking down the conduct and the prerequisites of the online customers, they expect cheapest deals and faster delivery and service. These are the essential requests of each customer who will be using e-commerce.  Telegram messenger according to Jakob Bjerre (2015) It has high security as it provides more security than any other messenger apps and the secret chat using encryption technique is an example for security and privacy, it is fast, and your recipient gets the data as quickly as you click the send button. Free, open source, and secure, makes Telegram easy to use for an application developer who wants modify the source code of Telegram messenger. By using Bot by Telegram Messenger developer can built application over Telegram and presents it to Telegram users. By that e-commerce system can use the advantage of Telegram bot to design and implementation system e-commerce that more efficient for the user.},

Social media platforms seem to be losing the battle against online hate19,20 and urgently need new insights. Here we show that the key to understanding the resilience of online hate lies in its global network-of-network dynamics. Interconnected hate clusters form global `hate highways' that---assisted by collective online adaptations---cross social media platforms, sometimes using `back doors' even after being banned, as well as jumping between countries, continents and languages. Our mathematical model predicts that policing within a single platform (such as Facebook) can make matters worse, and will eventually generate global `dark pools' in which online hate will flourish. We observe the current hate network rapidly rewiring and self-repairing at the micro level when attacked, in a way that mimics the formation of covalent bonds in chemistry. This understanding enables us to propose a policy matrix that can help to defeat online hate, classified by the preferred (or legally allowed) granularity of the intervention and top-down versus bottom-up nature. We provide quantitative assessments for the effects of each intervention. This policy matrix also offers a tool for tackling a broader class of illicit online behaviours21,22 such as financial fraud.},

Opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2--4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as well as dismissals of expert advice9--11. There is a lack of understanding about how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14. Here we provide a map of the contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global pool of around three billion Facebook users. Its core reveals a multi-sided landscape of unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100~million individuals partitioned into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across cities, countries, continents and languages. Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral. Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views. Our results challenge the conventional thinking about undecided individuals in issues of contention surrounding health, shed light on other issues of contention such as climate change11, and highlight the key role of network cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15.},

A pesquisa aponta que, apesar de os grupos anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o serem menores, eles est{\~a}o estrategicamente posicionados no centro das intera{\c c}{\~o}es, enquanto os grupos pr{\'o}-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o permanecem na periferia.
\par
Os grupos anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o s{\~a}o mais numerosos em termos de pequenos clusters e est{\~a}o mais integrados com os indecisos, que mostram o maior crescimento de intera{\c c}{\~o}es. Estes clusters anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o oferecem uma diversidade de narrativas atraentes, misturando preocupa{\c c}{\~o}es com seguran{\c c}a, teorias da conspira{\c c}{\~a}o e medicina alternativa, o que contribui para seu crescimento. Em contrapartida, as mensagens pr{\'o}-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o s{\~a}o mais mon{\'o}tonas e menos capazes de envolver o p{\'u}blico indeciso.
\par
Durante o surto de sarampo de 2019, os clusters anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o cresceram significativamente, enquanto os pr{\'o}-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o tiveram crescimento limitado. Um fator importante {\'e} que os clusters anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o menores, mais dif{\'i}ceis de serem detectados, mostram o maior crescimento, desafiando a ideia de que grupos maiores atraem mais adeptos. Esse fen{\^o}meno exige novas abordagens te{\'o}ricas e pol{\'i}ticas para lidar com a dissemina{\c c}{\~a}o de desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o sobre vacinas.
\par
Geograficamente, os clusters anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o tamb{\'e}m se beneficiam de uma presen{\c c}a tanto local quanto global, conectando-se atrav{\'e}s de redes online. Isso torna suas campanhas contra a vacina{\c c}{\~a}o mais resilientes e dif{\'i}ceis de combater, mesmo com o apoio de not{\'i}cias e campanhas favor{\'a}veis {\`a} vacina{\c c}{\~a}o.
\par
A pesquisa destaca a inefic{\'a}cia de modelos de a{\c c}{\~a}o massiva para prever o comportamento dessa ecologia online, sugerindo que novas estrat{\'e}gias precisam focar nas din{\^a}micas entre clusters, em vez de apenas se concentrar na rela{\c c}{\~a}o entre popula{\c c}{\~o}es pr{\'o} e anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o. Modelos te{\'o}ricos preveem que, sem interven{\c c}{\~o}es, as vis{\~o}es anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o podem se tornar dominantes em uma d{\'e}cada.
\par
Os autores sugerem que interven{\c c}{\~o}es em diferentes escalas podem ser efetivas, seja na redu{\c c}{\~a}o do crescimento de clusters espec{\'i}ficos ou na manipula{\c c}{\~a}o das din{\^a}micas de links entre clusters. Essas abordagens poderiam atrasar a ascens{\~a}o de novos clusters anti-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o e melhorar o engajamento das comunidades pr{\'o}-vacina{\c c}{\~a}o.

In this study, I argue that the far right's use of social media depends on technology affordances -- the linkage between platform design and usage -- and, thus, might not always be generalizable. After discussing six affordances -- persistence, scalability, replicability, connectivity, searchability, and identifiability -- I apply them to studies about the far right on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Telegram in a systematic literature review. I conclude that most research focuses on aspects linked to connectivity, scalability, and replicability, while persistence, searchability, and identifiability are barely researched so far. I further discuss shortcomings and possibilities for future research to consider aspect of technology affordances.},

  abstract = {Websites opposing vaccination are prevalent on the Internet. Web 2.0, defined by interaction and user-generated content, has become ubiquitous. Furthermore, a new postmodern paradigm of healthcare has emerged, where power has shifted from doctors to patients, the legitimacy of science is questioned, and expertise is redefined. Together this has created an environment where anti-vaccine activists are able to effectively spread their messages. Evidence shows that individuals turn to the Internet for vaccination advice, and suggests such sources can impact vaccination decisions - therefore it is likely that anti-vaccine websites can influence whether people vaccinate themselves or their children. This overview examines the types of rhetoric individuals may encounter online in order to better understand why the anti-vaccination movement can be convincing, despite lacking scientific support for their claims. Tactics and tropes commonly used to argue against vaccination are described. This includes actions such as skewing science, shifting hypotheses, censoring dissent, and attacking critics; also discussed are frequently made claims such as not being "anti-vaccine" but "pro-safe vaccines", that vaccines are toxic or unnatural, and more. Recognizing disingenuous claims made by the anti-vaccination movement is essential in order to critically evaluate the information and misinformation encountered online.},

Nowadays, the immense popularity of social networking websites such as Telegram has created new opportunities for English learners. Accordingly, the present study aims to investigate whether Telegram would be an effective and easy learning tool of vocabulary for Iranian female EFL learners at Intermediate Level at Payam Noor University, Babol, Iran. The participants in this study were 50 female EFL learners, ranging from 18-28 years old, selected from 100 cases. Pretest and posttest were also used to assess learners' knowledge about vocabulary taught during the session (four weeks). The data were collected and analyzed by SPSS. The results indicated that in spite of the popularity of social networks, Telegram learning can bring unique technological and pedagogical advantages for EFL learners and has a significantly positive effect on the development of vocabulary learning. The findings of this study are considered to be useful in English methodology issue.},

Regarding the telegram's popularity, there is a need to conduct thorough research into different aspects of using it. In order to carry out this study, different theories about everyday life were evaluated, especially Schutz's ideas. A combination of participant observation and qualitative interviews was employed as a methodology. Therefore, we participated constantly in a group and interviewed 8 telegram heavy users. The findings showed that the meaning of time in telegram has changed. Furthermore, a part of individuals' worlds has changed in the actual world by the telegram. Additionally, the shaping of ``Thou-orientations'' and ``We-relations'' are easier in the telegram. Most importantly, telegram disturbs the order of zones of relevance, changing and expanding them. Hence, some situations with low relevance are converted to the ones with high relevance. This phenomenon caused what Bayat called the quiet encroachment of the ordinary people. This is kind of resistance but not the only one. It is important to note that users employ this app as a field to create their techniques.}

Here, I try to prepare an appropriate background for future researches and at a same time study Iranian users' behavior in this App. Selecting Mack et al. ``What to observe'' framework as a base, I make it suitable to apply on Telegram groups. To do that, I started using Telegram on November 2014 until March 2016. During this time I observed more than 196 unsystematical groups and on September 2015, selected 43 groups for further study, after that I choose 8 groups for systematic observation and analyzed them from September 26 to October 9, 2015. Finally I suggest the ``What to observe'' framework consisting of Appearance, Messages and Discussions, Members Roles, Personal Space and Group Traffic.},

While most social media platforms have been studied extensively, Telegram is still underexplored and a gold mine for researchers and social scientists to explore and study user behaviors. Moreover, the ease of data collection through its API and access to historical data makes it a lucrative platform for social computing research. This paper explores the features of Telegram and presents a methodology to collect and analyze data. We also demonstrate the viability of the platform as a source of social computing research by presenting a case study on Ukrainian Parliamentary members' discourse. We conduct both text and network analysis to gain insights into political discourse and public opinion. Our findings include use of Telegram by Ukrainian politicians to connect with their voter base, promote their work as well as ridicule their peers. As a result, channels are actively disseminating information on current political affairs and chat groups that discuss views on Ukrainian government. From our study, we conclude that Telegram is a rich data source to study social behavior, analyze information campaigns through content dissemination, etc. This study opens plethora of research opportunities in future on Telegram.},

Interviews focused on an intense period of the movement exemplified by sit-in activities inspired by Occupy Wall Street in the USA. Whereas the use of Facebook for public discourse was similar to what has been reported in other studies, we found that an ecology of social media tools such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Google Docs mediated undercurrents that served to ground the public discourse of the movement. We discuss how the undercurrents sustained and developed public discourses in concrete ways.},

We systematically examine 94 articles (121 studies) that assess the role of (social) media in shaping political polarization. Using quantitative and qualitative approaches, we find an increase in research over the past 10 years and consistently find that pro-attitudinal media exacerbates polarization. We find a hyperfocus on analyses of Twitter and American samples and a lack of research exploring ways (social) media can depolarize. Additionally, we find ideological and affective polarization are not clearly defined, nor consistently measured. Recommendations for future research are provided.},

Internet jokes are visual collages, assembled from phrases and pictures from popular media which derive their humorous effect from a combination of elements of innocuous genres from media, commercial or popular culture with references to disaster. It is argued that the need for this genre of play is mainly a reaction to the ambivalent feelings provoked by the media coverage of these events.

And how does this construction relate to other forms of political subjectivity -- classes, corporations and other forms of association? Laclau's analysis of populist experiences begins with a critique of current approaches to populism, illustrated by two essential cases: the formation of a popular identity in French Jacobinism, and the dissolution of such an identity in the aftermath of British Chartism. This is followed by a discussion of the classical theories of mass psychology -- by Le Bon, Tarde, Freud, etc. -- and of the role of the lumpenproletariat in Marx's work. Finally Laclau examines a series of historical examples of populism, drawn mainly from American, Canadian, Argentinian and Turkish experiences},

  abstract = {The current study examined various types of misinformation related to the COVID-19 vaccines and their relationships to vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Study 1 asked a sample of full-time working professionals in the US (n\,=\,505) about possible misinformation they were exposed to related to the COVID-19 vaccines. Study 2 utilized an online survey to examine U.S. college students' (n\,=\,441) knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, and its associations with vaccine hesitancy and behavioral intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Analysis of open-ended responses in Study 1 revealed that 57.6\% reported being exposed to conspiratorial misinformation such as COVID-19 vaccines are harmful and dangerous. The results of a structural equation modeling analysis for Study 2 supported our hypotheses predicting a negative association between the knowledge level and vaccine hesitancy and between vaccine hesitancy and behavioral intention. Vaccine hesitancy mediated the relationship between the vaccine knowledge and behavioral intention. Findings across these studies suggest exposure to misinformation and believing it as true could increase vaccine hesitancy and reduce behavioral intention to get vaccinated.},

It features end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in secret chats based on their customised protocol called MTProto. This brand new protocol is believed as a safe alternative among the public, however, it is in doubt and has not been fully reviewed by cryptanalytic experts. It is theoretically demonstrated in 2015 that MTProto does not meet indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA) and integrity of ciphertexts (INT-CTXT). In this paper, we start to analyse the security vulnerabilities of E2EE in simplified Telegram in a heuristic manner and suggest typical building blocks for E2EE in general IM system.},

  abstract = {Fostering skepticism has been seen as key to addressing misinformation on social media. This article reveals that not all skepticism is ``healthy'' skepticism by theorizing, measuring, and testing the effects of two types of skepticism toward social media misinformation: accuracy- and identity-motivated skepticism. A two-wave panel survey experiment shows that when people's skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by accuracy motivations, they are less likely to believe in congruent misinformation later encountered. They also consume more mainstream media, which in turn reinforces accuracy-motivated skepticism. In contrast, when skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by identity motivations, people not only fall for congruent misinformation later encountered, but also disregard platform interventions that flag a post as false. Moreover, they are more likely to see social media misinformation as favoring opponents and intentionally avoid news on social media, both of which form a vicious cycle of fueling more identity-motivated skepticism.},

  abstract = {The emergence of big data and computational tools has introduced new possibilities for using large-scale textual sources in sociological research. Recent work in sociology of culture, science, and economic sociology has shown how computational text analysis can be used in theory building and testing. This review starts with an introduction of the history of computer-assisted text analysis in sociology and then proceeds to discuss five families of computational methods used in contemporary research. Using exemplary studies, it shows how dictionary methods, semantic and network analysis tools, language models, unsupervised, and supervised machine learning can assist sociologists with different analytical tasks. After presenting recent methodological developments, this review summarizes several important implications of using large datasets and computational methods to infer complex meaning in texts. Finally, it calls researchers from different methodological traditions to adopt text mining tools while remaining mindful of lessons learned from working with conventional data and methods.

  abstract = {COVID-19 misinformation became accessible and profitable through social media platforms, such as YouTube. Here we investigate if Brazilian YouTube channels previously identified as vaccine misinformation spreaders would also misinform their audience about COVID-19. Our analysis sample consists of 6 months of content (3,318 videos) from 50 Brazilian YouTube channels. We establish a protocol to classify the types of COVID-19 misinformation spread by the content creators, describing how the channels evade content moderation---disguising, replicating, and dispersing misinformation---and what tactics the content creators use to profit. Our analysis shows that these channels exploited COVID-19 misinformation to promote themselves, profiting in the process.},

For this, we collected through big data, the messages containing the word coronavirus, on three dates: Janu-ary 14, 21 and 28, 2020. Using data mining, we processed 122,026 posts in Portuguese and 934,095 in English. We observed that alre-ady at the beginning of the pandemic, there is a predominance of an epidemiological vocabulary that expresses feelings of alertness, concern and anger about the contagions that started in Wuhan, China. Still in January, these spread across Asia, Europe and the United States. From this methodology that maps the narratives in the chronology of the networks (which we name discursive timeli-ne), we conclude that living the fear of the unknown is the shared emotional basis that guides the behavior of those who turn to so-cial networks in search of (dis)information and conversation about the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Digital media play an important role in the contemporary rise in visibility of New Right and far-right activist groups online, offline, and in the mainstream media. This visibility has boosted their online and offline mobilization power. Through a live digital ethnographic analysis of the rise of Schild \& Vrienden, a recent Flemish far-right activist movement, I will argue that we should understand their online and offline activism as part of a ``metapolitical battle'' exploiting the affordances of digital media in a hybrid media system. Schild \& Vrienden, just like most contemporary New Right movements, draws ideological and strategic inspiration from ``La Nouvelle Droite,'' the French far-right school of thought. Following their lead, these activists focus first and foremost on the circulation and the normalization of ideas: the discursive or metapolitical battle for hegemony. Digital media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube prove to be ideal platforms for that metapolitical battle enabling them to gain considerable discursive power in a hybrid media system. This article argues that the distribution of New Right content on these platforms presupposes digital literacy and algorithmic activism. ``Algorithmic activists'' are defined as activists who use (theoretical or practical) knowledge about the relative weight certain signals have within the proceduralized choices the algorithms of the media platforms make as proxies of human judgment, to reach their (meta)political goals. In this sense, ``algorithmic activism'' contributes to spreading their message by interacting with the post to trigger the algorithms of the medium, so that they boost the popularity rankings.},

  abstract = {The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the first pandemic in history in which technology and social media are being used on a massive scale to keep people safe, informed, productive and connected.~At the same time, the technology we rely on to         keep connected and informed is enabling and amplifying an infodemic that continues to undermine the global response and jeopardizes measures to control the pandemic.~~An infodemic is an overabundance of information, both online and offline. It includes deliberate attempts to disseminate wrong information to undermine the public health response and advance alternative agendas of groups or individuals. Mis- and disinformation         can be harmful to people's physical and mental health; increase stigmatization; threaten precious health gains; and lead to poor observance of public health measures, thus reducing their effectiveness and endangering countries' ability         to stop the pandemic.Misinformation costs lives. Without the appropriate trust and correct information, diagnostic tests go unused, immunization campaigns (or campaigns to promote effective vaccines) will not meet their targets, and the virus will continue to thrive.Furthermore, disinformation is polarizing public debate on topics related to COVID-19; amplifying hate speech; heightening the risk of conflict, violence and human rights violations; and threatening long-terms prospects for advancing democracy, human         rights and social cohesion.~In this context, the UN Secretary- General launched the United Nations Communications Response initiative to combat the spread of mis- and disinformation in April 2020. The UN also issued a Guidance Note on Addressing and Countering COVID-19 related         Hate Speech (11 May 2020).~At the World Health Assembly in May 2020, WHO Member States passed Resolution WHA73.1 on the COVID-19 response. The Resolution recognizes that managing the infodemic is a critical part of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic: it calls on Member States         to provide reliable COVID-19 content, take measures to counter mis- and disinformation and leverage digital technologies across the response. The Resolution also calls on international organizations to address mis- and disinformation in the digital         sphere, work to prevent harmful cyber activities undermining the health response and support the provision of science-based data to the public.The UN system and civil society organizations are using their collective expertise and knowledge to respond to the infodemic. At the same time, as the pandemic continues to create uncertainty and anxiety, there is an urgent need for stronger action         to manage the infodemic, and for a coordinated approach among states, multi-lateral organizations, civil society and all other actors who have a clear role and responsibility in combatting mis- and disinformation.We call on Member States to develop and implement action plans to manage the infodemic by promoting the timely dissemination of accurate information, based on science and evidence,         to all communities, and in particular high-risk groups; and preventing the spread, and combating, mis- and disinformation while respecting freedom of expression.We urge Member States to engage and listen to their communities as they develop their national action plans, and to empower communities to develop solutions and resilience against         mis- and disinformation.We further call on all other stakeholders - including ~the media and social media platforms through which mis- and disinformation are disseminated, researchers and technologists who can design         and build effective strategies and tools to respond to the infodemic, civil society leaders and influencers - to collaborate with the UN system, with Member States and with each other, and to further strengthen their actions to disseminate accurate information and prevent the spread of ~mis- and disinformation.},

A good normative framework for the use of bots on social networking sites should have three components: bots should clearly be labeled as such, they should not contact other users without consent, and information collected by them should only be used for disclosed purposes.},

  abstract = {A political history of Telegram is offered, which shows that while Telegram's rhetoric emphasizes user security, privacy, and freedom of expression, the company fails to demonstrate that it actually lives up to these commitments. This paper offers a political history of Telegram, a platform that combines aspects of social networking with secure messaging, and whose vocal commitment to user privacy and freedom of expression has brought it into open conflict with a number of governments, most recently in Iran and Russia. A detailed project history traces Telegram's roots to Pavel Durov's ouster from Vkontakte, the social networking site he had founded, at the behest of the Kremlin. The paper then analyzes Telegram's ideology and politics by focusing, in turn, on Telegram's emergence in the context of Vladimir Putin's crackdown on technologically-enabled civil society; on Pavel Durov's cyber-libertarianism; and on Telegram's peculiar business model. The analysis shows that while Telegram's rhetoric emphasizes user security, privacy, and freedom of expression, the company fails to demonstrate that it actually lives up to these commitments. Rather than earning user trust through transparency and accountability, Telegram's value proposition hinges on blind trust on Pavel Durov's good intentions and his team's stated credentials.}

A finalidade dos autores era aproximar a classe trabalhadora das teorias pol{\'i}ticas que formariam as bases do comunismo na Europa. A empreitada resultou num texto claro e objetivo, que chegou aos quatro cantos do planeta e se tornou um dos principais acontecimentos pol{\'i}ticos do mundo moderno e contempor{\^a}neo.Nesta nova edi{\c c}{\~a}o, a soci{\'o}loga Sabrina Fernandes reapresenta O manifesto comunista em um pref{\'a}cio in{\'e}dito e um conjunto de notas que contextualizam as quest{\~o}es levantadas por Marx e Engels nos dias de hoje. Como eles, Sabrina compreende que o papel dos intelectuais deve extrapolar o {\^a}mbito dos especialistas para que as mensagens de transforma{\c c}{\~a}o social cheguem a muito mais pessoas. E aqui vemos um exemplo de como isso pode ser feito.Ela nos ajuda a entender o esp{\'i}rito mobilizador de O manifesto comunista na sua tarefa de informar sobre os mecanismos da explora{\c c}{\~a}o dos trabalhadores pela elite econ{\^o}mica -- e suas consequ{\^e}ncias mais imediatas. Essa explora{\c c}{\~a}o n{\~a}o define apenas os baixos n{\'i}veis de qualidade de vida da popula{\c c}{\~a}o, mas influi igualmente, hoje sabemos bem, nas agress{\~o}es aos biomas que est{\~a}o no centro do debate acerca da eminente mudan{\c c}a clim{\'a}tica.Al{\'e}m disso, Sabrina Fernandes reflete sobre acontecimentos recentes que transformaram o cotidiano das fam{\'i}lias -- desde a pandemia do novo Coronav{\'i}rus aos processos de uberiza{\c c}{\~a}o. Essas novas condi{\c c}{\~o}es sociais dificultam ainda mais a organiza{\c c}{\~a}o pol{\'i}tica dos trabalhadores em torno de objetivos comuns, como ansiavam Marx e Engels, sobretudo neste tempo em que for{\c c}as pol{\'i}ticas reacion{\'a}rias se somam aos esfor{\c c}os neoliberais para destruir a prote{\c c}{\~a}o social e, ao mesmo tempo, fragilizar a estabilidade das democracias.},

Com base na coleta dos 100 links mais compartilhados, curtidos e comentados entre maio de 2018 e maio de 2019, por meio da palavra-chave ``vacina'', foram identificadas os principais assuntos, fontes e posicionamentos. Em uma etapa qualitativa, foi empregado o m{\'e}todo da An{\'a}lise do Discurso para identificar os modos de produ{\c c}{\~a}o de sentido em torno dos quais as conversa{\c c}{\~o}es em rede se concentraram. Foi estudada ainda qual a participa{\c c}{\~a}o das fake news entre os links mais compartilhados. Os resultados apontam que h{\'a} majoritariamente uma disposi{\c c}{\~a}o pr{\'o}-vacina (87,6\%) e um forte interesse em temas ligados {\`a} sa{\'u}de, ao desenvolvimento cient{\'i}fico e {\`a}s pol{\'i}ticas de sa{\'u}de. Por outro lado, parte das fontes de informa{\c c}{\~a}o mais acessadas pelos brasileiros n{\~a}o traz informa{\c c}{\~o}es sobre crit{\'e}rios editoriais, pol{\'i}ticas ou autores, o que pode dificultar a apreens{\~a}o da qualidade e veracidade das informa{\c c}{\~o}es consumidas.

The 100 most widely shared, liked, and commented links were visited with the keyword ``vaccine'' from May 2018 to May 2019 to identify the main subjects, sources, and positions. The qualitative study phase used Discourse Analysis to identify modes of production of principal meanings in the chats. We further studied the fake news in the most widely shared links. The results point to a majority position in favor of vaccines (87.6\%) and strong interest in health-related themes, scientific development, and health policies. Meanwhile, some of the mostly widely accessed sources of information in Brazil had no information on editorial criteria, policies, or authors, making it difficult to determine the quality and veracity of the information consumed in social networks in Brazil. Fake news accounted for 13.5\% of the links with the heaviest traffic, raising concerns about misinformation on vaccines. These results point to important communication dynamics related to vaccines and opportunities to improve public communication on vaccination.           ,              Resumen: El objetivo de esta investigaci{\'o}n es investigar la participaci{\'o}n activa y las interacciones en las redes sociales sobre las vacunas. En base a la recogida de los 100 enlaces m{\'a}s compartidos, con ``me gusta'', y comentados entre mayo de 2018 y mayo de 2019, mediante la palabra-clave ``vacuna'', fueron identificados los principales asuntos, fuentes y posicionamientos.

Asimismo, se estudi{\'o} cu{\'a}l es la participaci{\'o}n de las fake news entre los enlaces m{\'a}s compartidos. Los resultados apuntan que existe mayoritariamente una disposici{\'o}n pro-vacuna (87,6\%) y un fuerte inter{\'e}s en temas relacionados con la salud, con el desarrollo cient{\'i}fico y las pol{\'i}ticas de salud. Por otro lado, parte de las fuentes de informaci{\'o}n m{\'a}s consultadas por los brasile{\~n}os no proporcionaron informaci{\'o}n sobre criterios editoriales, pol{\'i}ticas o autores, lo que puede dificultar la aprehensi{\'o}n de la calidad y veracidad de la informaci{\'o}n consumida. Asimismo, las fake news representaron un 13,5\% de los enlaces con mayor participaci{\'o}n, lo que indica un dato preocupante respecto a la desinformaci{\'o}n sobre las vacunas. Estos resultados indican importantes din{\'a}micas de comunicaci{\'o}n sobre las vacunas y oportunidades para una mejora en la comunicaci{\'o}n p{\'u}blica en torno a este tema.},

Identificamos que o engajamento m{\'e}dio aumentou 8,6 vezes e que a predomin{\^a}ncia de informa{\c c}{\~o}es verificadas se manteve antes e durante a pandemia. Contudo, o engajamento da desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o cresceu de maneira expressiva e seu perfil mudou: se em 2018-2019 predominavam os conte{\'u}dos totalmente falsos e emitidos por ve{\'i}culos n{\~a}o profissionais, em 2020 se destacam as informa{\c c}{\~o}es distorcidas por manchetes sensacionalistas emitidas por ve{\'i}culos profissionais.

However, an increasing vaccine hesitancy has been associated with disinformation on social networks. In this context, it is important to investigate which contents about vaccines have been most consumed in these spaces. In our article, we analyze one hundred links containing the word ``vaccine'' with more engagement in social networks between May 22, 2018, and May 21, 2019, using an adapted version of the content analysis protocol developed by the Ibero-American Network for Monitoring and Training in Science Journalism. Our aim is to investigate the speeches, frameworks and broadcasters that most mobilized the public debate in these digital platforms. By analyzing the general characteristics, the themes, the narratives, the treatment and the actors mobilized by these contents, we conclude that, although they mostly convey a positive view about vaccines and bring verifiable data, there are gaps in the capacity to remedy possible doubts concerning vaccines and explain how vaccination should be inserted in people's daily health care.},

Through the examination of a popular WhatsApp meme in Spain, I show how everyday socio-technical practices on this platform perpetuate power hierarchies based on race. As a first step, the paper links ``El Negro de WhatsApp'' meme with the long racist tradition of commodifying black bodies in American popular culture and beyond. Second, I argue that encrypted services like WhatsApp facilitate and amplify what Picca and Feagin (2007) refer to as the ``backstage'' of racism. The article concludes outlining the challenges of private, encrypted services if we are to dismantle `platformed racism'.},

While better models for hate speech detection are continuously being developed, there is little research on the bias and interpretability aspects of hate speech. In this paper, we introduce HateXplain, the first benchmark hate speech dataset covering multiple aspects of the issue. Each post in our dataset is annotated from three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class classification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e., the community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the post), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their labelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in classification do not score high on explainability metrics like model plausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the human rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias towards target communities. We have made our code and dataset public for other researchers.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic health and social event that requires continuous observation. Here, we examine the 100 most engaged social media links in 2022 with the keyword ``vaccine'' and compare them to the data from 2020 and 2021. Based on Content Analysis, we classified the data into six categories: engagement, theme, accuracy, positioning, risk calculation, and vehicle type. The results confirm the downward trend in the total engagement and in the presence of disinformation, noticed since 2021. The chronological analysis suggests that the themes of greatest engagement are directly related to the different phases of the pandemic in Brazil, influencing and being influenced by them.},

  abstract = {Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.},

Therefore, this article aims to map and identify the discursive strategies used by the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, to mobilize meanings about Covid-19 in his Telegram's official channel. With the analysis of 251 messages published between January and June 2021, it was possible to observe that Bolsonaro incites and reproduces meanings about Covid-19 based on moral warning narratives, which are supported by authoritative speeches, and that he structures the Telegram as one more place to register their actions in the federal government and to spread ``truths'' to their supporters.},

On one side the alt right ranges from the once obscure neo-reactionary and white separatist movements, to geeky subcultures like 4chan, to more mainstream manifestations such as the Trump-supporting gay libertarian Milo Yiannopolous. On the other side, a culture of struggle sessions and virtue signalling lurks behind a therapeutic language of trigger warnings and safe spaces. The feminist side of the online culture wars has its equally geeky subcultures right through to its mainstream expression. Kill All Normies explores some of the cultural genealogies and past parallels of these styles and subcultures, drawing from transgressive styles of 60s libertinism and conservative movements, to make the case for a rejection of the perpetual cultural turn"--back cover},

A partir de 188.198 mensagens de texto compartilhadas no per{\'i}odo de janeiro a dezembro de 2020, foram filtradas e analisadas as comunica{\c c}{\~o}es relacionadas com tr{\^e}s posicionamentos controversos do governo federal: a oposi{\c c}{\~a}o {\`a}s medidas de distanciamento social, a defesa do uso da hidroxicloroquina como tratamento precoce para a Covid-19 e, por fim, a neglig{\^e}ncia e/ou descr{\'e}dito em rela{\c c}{\~a}o {\`a} vacina{\c c}{\~a}o. Argumentamos ser poss{\'i}vel compreender a atua{\c c}{\~a}o do presidente Bolsonaro como um exerc{\'i}cio de poder oracular de um l{\'i}der populista digital.

This study focuses on the spread of disinformation propagated by this group on Telegram, a mobile messaging and social media platform. After segregating users into three groups---the Disinformation Dozen, bots, and humans, we perform an investigation with a dataset of Telegram messages from January to June 2023, comparatively analyzing temporal, topical, and network features. We observe that the Disinformation Dozen are highly involved in the initial dissemination of disinformation but are not the main drivers of the propagation of disinformation. Bot users are extremely active in conversation threads, while human users are active propagators of information, disseminating posts between Telegram channels through the forwarding mechanism.},

  abstract = {Discussion of the phenomena of post-truth and fake news often implicates the closed epistemic networks of social media. The recent conversation has, however, blurred two distinct social epistemic phenomena. An epistemic bubble is a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out, perhaps accidentally. An echo chamber is a social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited. Members of epistemic bubbles lack exposure to relevant information and arguments. Members of echo chambers, on the other hand, have been brought to systematically distrust all outside sources. In epistemic bubbles, other voices are not heard; in echo chambers, other voices are actively undermined. It is crucial to keep these phenomena distinct. First, echo chambers can explain the post-truth phenomena in a way that epistemic bubbles cannot. Second, each type of structure requires a distinct intervention. Mere exposure to evidence can shatter an epistemic bubble, but may actually reinforce an echo chamber. Finally, echo chambers are much harder to escape. Once in their grip, an agent may act with epistemic virtue, but social context will pervert those actions. Escape from an echo chamber may require a radical rebooting of one's belief system.},

Recent reports indicate that lurkers make up over 90\% of online groups, yet little is known about them. This paper presents a demographic study of lurking in email-based discussion lists (DLs) with an emphasis on health and software-support DLs. Four primary questions are examined. One, how prevalent is lurking, and do health and software-support DLs differ? Two, how do lurking levels vary as the definition is broadened from zero posts in 12 weeks to 3 or fewer posts in 12 weeks? Three, is there a relationship between lurking and the size of the DL, and four, is there a relationship between lurking and traffic level? When lurking is defined as no posts, the mean lurking level for all DLs is lower than the reported 90\%. Health-support DLs have on average significantly fewer lurkers (46\%) than software-support DLs (82\%). Lurking varies widely ranging from 0 to 99\%. The relationships between lurking, group size and traffic are also examined.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Over the years, vaccinations have provided significant advances in public health, because they substantially reduce the morbimortality of vaccine-preventable diseases. Nevertheless, many people are still hesitant to be vaccinated. Brazil is a region of many anti-vaccine movements, and several outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as yellow fever and measles, have occurred in the country during the last few years. To avoid new outbreaks, immunization coverage must be high; however, this is a great challenge to achieve due to the countless anti-vaccine movements. The World Health Organization has suggested new actions for the next decade via the Immunization Agenda 2030 to control, reduce, or eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases. Nonetheless, the vaccination coverage has decreased recently. To resolve the anti-vaccine issue, it is necessary to propose a long-term approach that involves innovative education programs on immunization and critical thinking, using different communication channels, including social media. Cooperation among biology and health scientists, ethicists, human scientists, policymakers, journalists, and civil society is essential for an in-depth understanding of the social action of vaccine refusal and planning effective education measures to increase the vaccine coverage.},

We examine how theoretical positionings, including from actor--network theory, new materialisms, ontologies, and cosmopolitics, have helped expand anthropological climate research, particularly in three key interrelated areas. First, we investigate ethnographic approaches to climate science knowledge production, particularly around epistemic authority, visioning of futures, and engagements with the material world. Second, we consider climate adaptation studies that critically examine discourses and activities surrounding concepts of vulnerability, subjectivities, and resilience. Third, we analyze climate mitigation, including energy transitions, technological optimism, market-based solutions, and other ways of living in a carbon-constrained world. We conclude that anthropological approaches provide novel perspectives, made possible through engagements with our uniquely situated research partners, as well as opportunities for opening up diverse solutions and possible transformative futures.},

Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly-some of the same figures who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole.

The final sample was n = 12, including only articles published in the last 10 years, in English or Spanish. Social networks are used by the anti-vaccine groups to disseminate their information. To do this, these groups use different methods, including bots and trolls that generate anti-vaccination messages and spread quickly. In addition, the arguments that they use focus on possible harmful effects and the distrust of pharmaceuticals, promoting the use of social networks as a resource for finding health-related information. The anti-vaccine groups are able to use social networks and their resources to increase their number and do so through controversial arguments, such as the economic benefit of pharmaceuticals or personal stories of children to move the population without using reliable or evidence-based content.},

By harnessing in-depth expert interviews with documentarians of the office?s daily operations?researchers, journalists, and fact-checkers (N?=?10)?this study draws up a chronology of the OOH. Via this methodological approach, we trace and chronologize events, actions, and actors associated with the OOH. Specifically, findings (a) document the rise of antipetismo and disinformation campaigns associated with attacks on the Brazilian Worker?s party from 2012 until the election of Bolsonaro in 2018, (b) describe the emergence of the OOH at the heels of the election and subsequent radicalization in WhatsApp groups, (c) provide an overview of the types of disinformation that are spread on the app by the OOH, and (d) illustrate how the OOH operates by mapping key actors and places, communicative strategies, and audiences. These findings are discussed in light of ramifications that government-sponsored forms of disinformation might have in other antidemocratic polities marked by strongman populist leadership.},

Thus, this study aims to extend the real knowledge about the positive and negative alternatives of the two options, based on the results of 3 years of work, using forums in Moodle and using groups in Telegram. The results show that the students perceive the Telegram groups as much more dynamic, close and fast than the forums, groups also allowed a greater interaction between students (cooperation in the development and solution of problems). The data also show a greater engagement and activity of the students who joined the Telegram group in contrast with those who used the Moodle forums. More than 90\% of the students also indicated that they wish to continue to have Telegram class-groups in the future.},

The troll space isn't the only space worth interrogating, however. During this same period, there was a marked overlap between subcultural trolling and the nebulous, discursive category known colloquially as ``internet culture.'' Both were swiftly absorbed into broader popular culture. Both were characterized by overwhelming irony and detached, fetishized laughter. That participants in these early internet culture spaces (which included but were not limited to ``classic'' subcultural trolling) were overwhelmingly white, middle class, and felt comfortable enough in their subject positions to respond to the world with a blanket ``lol'' speaks to much deeper problems than the obvious problems. Pressingly, the things that were---and that for some people, still are---fun and funny and apparently harmless online need more careful unpacking. Fun and funny and apparently harmless things have a way of obscuring weapons that privileged people cannot see, because they do not have to see them. They also have a way of establishing precedent and a step-by-step media manipulation guide that is easily hijacked by those looking to do harm, whose actions often fly under the radar---because those actions look familiar, because they look like the things that used to be fun.},

If the presence of data is part of the environments we inhabit, this raises the question of how and why data is valuable to us and what forms of hope and trust enable this value to further develop.},

This problem has arisen due to the emergence of various concomitant phenomena such as 1) the digitization of human life and the ease of disseminating news through social networking applications (such as Facebook and WhatsApp); 2) the availability of ``big data'' that allows customization of news feeds and the creation of polarized so-called ``filter-bubbles''; and 3) the rapid progress made by generative machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in creating realistic-looking yet fake digital content (such as text, images, and videos). There is a crucial need to combat the rampant rise of fake news and disinformation.

  abstract = {As a significant source of misinformation, out-of-context visual misinformation refers to visuals presented in an unrelated context. This study explores whether a digital media literacy intervention that features reverse image search tools has significant effects on participants' message credibility judgment, discernment of visual misinformation, and intention of using reverse image search tools. Data were collected from a pre-registered, web-based, between-subjects experiment (N\,=\,905). Results revealed a significant difference on intention of using reverse search tools among three experimental conditions: active intervention that involved both knowledge and behavior, passive intervention that involved knowledge only, and a control condition. Specifically, active intervention significantly increased intention of using reverse search tools, compared to the passive intervention and the control. Neither active nor passive intervention had an effect on credibility judgment or misinformation discernment. We discuss the implications for future digital media intervention designs and journalism practice that aim to combat visual misinformation.Social media platforms have become a fertile ground for producing and disseminating visual misinformation. One specific form of visual misinformation involves images that are presented in a false context. We designed a digital media literacy intervention that motivates and teaches users to reverse search news images when they encounter news posts on social media. We ran an online experiment comparing three groups, namely active intervention that involved providing information and instructing a reverse search practice, passive intervention that only involved providing information, and a control group where participants read irrelevant information. We found that active intervention increased individuals' motivation to use reverse image search in the future compared to passive intervention and the control group. The intervention did not have an impact on the evaluation of message credibility and misinformation discernment. Our findings suggest the potential of using a brief digital media literacy intervention to motivate future image verification practices among social media users. Social media platforms are recommended to empower users with digital literacy interventions to foster critical media consumption habits.},

  abstract = {Background: The ``infodemic'' accompanying the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has the potential to increase avoidable spread as well as engagement in risky health behaviors. Although social media platforms, such as YouTube, can be an inexpensive and effective method of sharing accurate health information, inaccurate and misleading information shared on YouTube can be dangerous for viewers. The confusing nature of data and claims surrounding the benefits of vitamin D, particularly in the prevention or cure of COVID-19, influences both viewers and the general ``immune boosting'' commercial interest. Objective: The aim of this study was to ascertain how information on vitamin D and COVID-19 was presented on YouTube in 2020. Methods: YouTube video results for the search terms ``COVID,'' ``coronavirus,'' and ``vitamin D'' were collected and analyzed for content themes and deemed useful or misleading based on the accuracy or inaccuracy of the content. Qualitative content analysis and simple statistical analysis were used to determine the prevalence and frequency of concerning content, such as confusing correlation with causation regarding vitamin D benefits. Results: In total, 77 videos with a combined 10,225,763 views (at the time of data collection) were included in the analysis, with over three-quarters of them containing misleading content about COVID-19 and vitamin D. In addition, 45 (58\%) of the 77 videos confused the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19, with 46 (85\%) of 54 videos stating that vitamin D has preventative or curative abilities. The major contributors to these videos were medical professionals with YouTube accounts. Vitamin D recommendations that do not align with the current literature were frequently suggested, including taking supplementation higher than the recommended safe dosage or seeking intentional solar UV radiation exposure. Conclusions: The spread of misinformation is particularly alarming when spread by medical professionals, and existing data suggesting vitamin D has immune-boosting abilities can add to viewer confusion or mistrust in health information. Further, the suggestions made in the videos may increase the risks of other poor health outcomes, such as skin cancer from solar UV radiation.},

  abstract = {Introduction The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of using telegram on promoting the environmental behavior of tourism students. The theoretical framework of this research is based on the theory of communicative action of Habermas (Translated by Burger, 1991), Wolkhart theory about the influence of groups (Zanjani and Mohamad Javadi, 2005), Mass communication theory (Ognyanova and Ball-Rokeach, 2015) and the theory of the Castells network society(Translated by Aligholian et al., 2010), The importance of this research is that it familiarizes the policymakers of the environmental education in tourism with the effect of telegram as one of ICT-based social networks on environmental education and promotion of pro-environmental behavior among tourism students. Materials and Methods In terms of the methodology, this research is quasi-experimental with pretest-posttest and control group. The study sample included 40 students of the Payame Noor University of Markazi province that who were selected by the available sampling method and were randomly assigned into study as well as control groups. At first, both groups were given the pretest and afterwards the necessary trainings based on the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP, 2015) and the terms and culture of the country were provided in the form of text, image and video posts on the created group of Telegram. After 3 months, in order to measure the effect of the provided environmental training through Telegram, the students were given the posttest. The data collection tool included a questionnaire (Salehi et al., 2012) whose content validity was quantitatively and qualitatively as well as reliability-wise confirmed. The data were then analyzed through using the descriptive and inferential statistics and SPSS software. Results and discussion: According to the results of the covariance analysis test and with respect to the fact that the significance level of the test in environmental behavior of tourism that it indicates the effect of the environmental education with the help of telegram on the promotion of the students' environmental behavior of tourism. The mean comparison of the pretest and posttest has shown that the mean variable of the posttest compared to the pretest was higher in this variable. Also, the results of the post hoc test have shown that the mean of the telegram group was higher than the mean of the control group in this variable. The effect of training through Telegram for the variable of pro-environmental behavior in tourism of the study group was respectively .567. Conclusion Pro-environmental tourism education through Telegram has a positive and significant effect on dimension of students' Pro-environmental behavior in tourism. Respectively, about 57\% of the variance pro-environmental behavior in tourism of the study group can be explained exclusively by applying the training method (environmental education of Telegram). This confirms that it is possible to use the capacity of this messenger's social network for environmental education related to tourism to students. The results of this study seem to be consistent with theory of communicative action Habermas, Wolkhart theory about the influence of groups, Mass communication theory and the theory of the network society. The theoretical achievement of this research can be confirmed the need to consider and use the capacities of virtual social networks in promoting environmental tourism behaviors and turning them into opportunities for this field.

  abstract = {When toxic online communities on mainstream platforms face moderation measures, such as bans, they may migrate to other platforms with laxer policies or set up their own dedicated websites. Previous work suggests that within mainstream platforms, community-level moderation is effective in mitigating the harm caused by the moderated communities. It is, however, unclear whether these results also hold when considering the broader Web ecosystem. Do toxic communities continue to grow in terms of their user base and activity on the new platforms? Do their members become more toxic and ideologically radicalized? In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale observational study of how problematic online communities progress following community-level moderation measures. We analyze data from r/The\_Donald and r/Incels, two communities that were banned from Reddit and subsequently migrated to their own standalone websites. Our results suggest that, in both cases, moderation measures significantly decreased posting activity on the new platform, reducing the number of posts, active users, and newcomers. In spite of that, users in one of the studied communities (r/The\_Donald) showed increases in signals associated with toxicity and radicalization, which justifies concerns that the reduction in activity may come at the expense of a more toxic and radical community. Overall, our results paint a nuanced portrait of the consequences of community-level moderation and can inform their design and deployment.},

  abstract = {Algorithms, as constitutive elements of online platforms, are increasingly shaping everyday sociability. Developing suitable empirical approaches to render them accountable and to study their social power has become a prominent scholarly concern. This article proposes an approach to examine what an algorithm does, not only to move closer to understanding how it works, but also to investigate broader forms of agency involved. To do this, we examine YouTube's search results ranking over time in the context of seven sociocultural issues. Through a combination of rank visualizations, computational change metrics and qualitative analysis, we study search ranking as the distributed accomplishment of `ranking cultures'. First, we identify three forms of ordering over time -- stable, `newsy' and mixed rank morphologies. Second, we observe that rankings cannot be easily linked back to popularity metrics, which highlights the role of platform features such as channel subscriptions in processes of visibility distribution. Third, we find that the contents appearing in the top 20 results are heavily influenced by both issue and platform vernaculars. YouTube-native content, which often thrives on controversy and dissent, systematically beats out mainstream actors in terms of exposure. We close by arguing that ranking cultures are embedded in the meshes of mutually constitutive agencies that frustrate our attempts at causal explanation and are better served by strategies of `descriptive assemblage'.},

  abstract = {The amount of uploaded extremist propaganda on the internet is increasing. In particular, right-wing extremist as well as Islamic extremist groups take advantage of the opportunities presented by the internet to spread their ideas to worldwide masses. Both tackle in-group specific topics and address their audiences in their respective political, national or religious identities. Several factors, such as higher levels of authoritarian value orientations and threatening life situations (such as existential threats or psychological uncertainty) have been found to shape people's reactions towards radical groups as well as to propaganda. The current study investigated whether the response to extremist propaganda videos (namely, aversion felt for the video and the perceived persuasiveness of the video) is shaped by an individual's authoritarian attitudes and psychological uncertainty and whether this is a global process or in-group specific. Further, it considered the effects of exposure to extremist propaganda on the identification with one's in-group. In a laboratory experiment, German students were confronted with a right-wing extremist and an Islamic extremist video after manipulating their level of uncertainty (high vs. low levels of psychological uncertainty).~ The results confirmed that the interaction between authoritarianism and psychological uncertainty affected the evaluation of right-wing extremist videos addressing participants' national in-group. Under conditions of uncertainty, authoritarianism predicted less aversion and a higher persuasiveness of these videos. Further, psychological uncertainty increased the identification with participants' German nationality, irrespective of authoritarian attitudes. Notably, the effect was in-group bound: The same effect was not found for Islamic extremist propaganda referring to a religious out-group. The results are discussed regarding the potential of propaganda to foster behavioral intentions and engagement in extremist groups in specific threatening situations.},

  abstract = {This dissertation argues that Black mothering is the re-creation of Black sociability in the African Diaspora in the face of the ways in which genocide attempts to eliminate black existence. Therefore, I argue for an approach to African Diaspora as creating, nurturing, resisting, and recuperative acts as an alternative to genocidal practices, which constitutes black mothering. Concerning genocidal practices, this dissertation focuses mainly on anti-black violence, specifically male-on-male and state-sponsored violence; although with an understanding that genocide also manifests itself through many other ways. The choice to focus on male-on-male and state violence is because I understand them as being the ultimate alternative to put forward genocidal ideologies when others fail. Thus, understanding the violent killing of the black population as the most visible expression of genocide in the African Diaspora, I want to confront them with their alternative, which is the given social, cultural, and biological significance of motherhood, i.e., to generate and nurture life. Therefore, my ethnographic project explores Black mothers' experiences of violence in Rio de Janeiro's poorest areas. Their struggle to survive encompasses not only their own fight against poverty, racism, patriarchy, and gender discrimination but also entails the consequences of violent acts perpetrated or facilitated by the state upon their families. Engaging with the analytical concept of Outraged Mothering, this dissertation builds bridges between African Diaspora Studies and the Anthropology of Emotions by applying a Black Feminist perspective in order to perceive Black mothers' social-political insertion in society as well as their pedagogies of resistance. My research methods include participant observation, semi-structured interviews, oral histories, and documentary photography conducted in an extended period of seventeen months of fieldwork research between 2011 and 2012. This project embraces activism as a learning experience in the collaboration with the mothers in struggle, and employs auto-ethnography as a way to think critically through the researcher's emotions while conducting and writing the project. This project aims to enhance developing literature on Black motherhood in Brazil and explores Black lives in the African Diaspora through an analytical framework that presents emotion as a catalytic stimulus for the rise of radical political projects.},

  abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy poses a significant global health challenge, fueled by misinformation and anti-vaccination campaigns on social media platforms (SMPs). This study examines the influence of social media on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 vaccination in Asia during the peri-pandemic period. Through a comprehensive analysis of available literature, we aim to elucidate the role of SMPs in shaping vaccination attitudes and behaviors. The findings highlight the detrimental impact of social media on vaccination efforts and provide insights into addressing vaccine hesitancy during this critical period. A narrative review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from inception to May 26, 2022. Only English-language articles involving human participants from Asian countries were included in this review. Out of the 228 articles identified through the database search, 14 articles were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy or negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in Asian countries was found to be high, ranging from 20\% to 55\% across countries. Notably, reliance on SMPs for vaccine-related information was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. This trend coincided with the proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy theories that portrayed COVID-19 vaccines as harmful during the pandemic. Similar patterns were observed for other types of vaccines, including polio, measles mumps and rubella, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines. The use of SMPs was also found to be associated with increased fear among caregivers in Asian countries, as well as a 3--4 times higher likelihood of delayed immunization. SMPs negatively impact vaccine intent in Asia due to misinformation and anti-vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. However, they can be a powerful tool for healthcare providers and policymakers to promote informed decision-making. Efforts should focus on leveraging SMPs to disseminate reliable information and combat hesitancy, fostering a well-informed and vaccinated population in Asia.},

\item \textbf{Introdu{\c c}{\~a}o {\`a} Hesita{\c c}{\~a}o Vacinal}: O artigo aborda a hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal, um desafio global que foi intensificado pelas campanhas anti-vacinas e pela desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o nas plataformas de m{\'i}dia social (SMPs). Durante a pandemia de COVID-19, essa hesita{\c c}{\~a}o foi particularmente vis{\'i}vel em muitos pa{\'i}ses asi{\'a}ticos, onde a confian{\c c}a nas SMPs aumentou o n{\'u}mero de pessoas que se opunham {\`a}s vacinas. O estudo revisa a influ{\^e}ncia das SMPs sobre as atitudes de vacina{\c c}{\~a}o contra COVID-19 e outras doen{\c c}as na {\'A}sia, analisando literatura dispon{\'i}vel.
\item \textbf{Impacto das M{\'i}dias Sociais}: As SMPs foram identificadas como fontes importantes de desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o sobre vacinas, o que resultou em maior hesita{\c c}{\~a}o em vacinar. Especificamente, houve uma correla{\c c}{\~a}o clara entre a confian{\c c}a nas SMPs e a relut{\^a}ncia em receber vacinas, com pessoas mais propensas a acreditar em teorias da conspira{\c c}{\~a}o e informa{\c c}{\~o}es erradas sobre os efeitos adversos das vacinas, o que dificultou os esfor{\c c}os de imuniza{\c c}{\~a}o.
\item \textbf{Busca por Informa{\c c}{\~o}es}: O estudo se concentrou em artigos de pa{\'i}ses asi{\'a}ticos dispon{\'i}veis em ingl{\^e}s at{\'e} maio de 2022, utilizando termos de pesquisa relacionados {\`a} vacina{\c c}{\~a}o e hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal nas SMPs. Foram inclu{\'i}dos 14 artigos de uma amostra inicial de 228 estudos. Esses artigos destacaram que a confian{\c c}a nas informa{\c c}{\~o}es sobre vacinas encontradas nas SMPs estava fortemente ligada a uma maior probabilidade de atraso ou recusa de imuniza{\c c}{\~o}es.
\item \textbf{Fatores Culturais e Pol{\'i}ticos}: No contexto asi{\'a}tico, a hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal est{\'a} enraizada em fatores culturais e pol{\'i}ticos espec{\'i}ficos. Por exemplo, em algumas sociedades asi{\'a}ticas, h{\'a} uma tend{\^e}ncia cultural a preferir rem{\'e}dios naturais e a desconfiar da medicina moderna. Al{\'e}m disso, quest{\~o}es pol{\'i}ticas, como a desconfian{\c c}a em rela{\c c}{\~a}o aos governos, tamb{\'e}m influenciam a percep{\c c}{\~a}o p{\'u}blica sobre vacinas.
\item \textbf{Propaga{\c c}{\~a}o de Mitos nas SMPs}: Durante a pandemia de COVID-19, teorias da conspira{\c c}{\~a}o como a inser{\c c}{\~a}o de nanochips nas vacinas e a cren{\c c}a de que as vacinas poderiam alterar o DNA ou causar infertilidade proliferaram nas SMPs, especialmente em pa{\'i}ses como Jord{\^a}nia e Paquist{\~a}o. Esses mitos contribu{\'i}ram para a resist{\^e}ncia {\`a}s vacinas, prejudicando os esfor{\c c}os de imuniza{\c c}{\~a}o em massa.
\item \textbf{Desafios Al{\'e}m da COVID-19}: Embora o foco estivesse em vacinas contra a COVID-19, a hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal tamb{\'e}m afetou outros programas de vacina{\c c}{\~a}o, como os esfor{\c c}os para erradicar a poliomielite e campanhas contra o sarampo. No Paquist{\~a}o, por exemplo, uma campanha de desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o sobre a vacina oral contra poliomielite resultou em um grande aumento no n{\'u}mero de crian{\c c}as n{\~a}o vacinadas.
\item \textbf{Uso Positivo das SMPs}: O estudo tamb{\'e}m destaca o potencial positivo das SMPs como ferramentas para melhorar a aceita{\c c}{\~a}o de vacinas. As plataformas de m{\'i}dia social podem ser utilizadas por profissionais de sa{\'u}de e formuladores de pol{\'i}ticas para disseminar informa{\c c}{\~o}es precisas e combater a hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal, promovendo decis{\~o}es informadas e aumentando a confian{\c c}a nas vacinas.
\item \textbf{Conclus{\~a}o e Limita{\c c}{\~o}es}: O artigo conclui que as SMPs tiveram um impacto negativo sobre a inten{\c c}{\~a}o de vacina{\c c}{\~a}o na {\'A}sia, embora o estudo tenha limita{\c c}{\~o}es, como a exclus{\~a}o de alguns pa{\'i}ses e a natureza mut{\'a}vel das SMPs. A solu{\c c}{\~a}o para combater a hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal inclui a redu{\c c}{\~a}o da interfer{\^e}ncia pol{\'i}tica e a promo{\c c}{\~a}o de fontes confi{\'a}veis de informa{\c c}{\~o}es nas SMPs, garantindo que as popula{\c c}{\~o}es recebam informa{\c c}{\~o}es precisas sobre vacina{\c c}{\~a}o.

Using five national samples from the UK (n = 1050 and n = 1150), Ireland (n = 700), the USA (n = 700), Spain (n = 700) and Mexico (n = 700), we examine predictors of belief in the most common statements about the virus that contain misinformation. We also investigate the prevalence of belief in COVID-19 misinformation across different countries and the role of belief in such misinformation in predicting relevant health behaviours. We find that while public belief in misinformation about COVID-19 is not particularly common, a substantial proportion views this type of misinformation as highly reliable in each country surveyed. In addition, a small group of participants find common factual information about the virus highly unreliable. We also find that increased susceptibility to misinformation negatively affects people's self-reported compliance with public health guidance about COVID-19, as well as people's willingness to get vaccinated against the virus and to recommend the vaccine to vulnerable friends and family. Across all countries surveyed, we find that higher trust in scientists and having higher numeracy skills were associated with lower susceptibility to coronavirus-related misinformation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a clear link between susceptibility to misinformation and both vaccine hesitancy and a reduced likelihood to comply with health guidance measures, and suggest that interventions which aim to improve critical thinking and trust in science may be a promising avenue for future research.},

Given the importance of the issue, the purpose of this descriptive- correlative research was to study the factors affecting students' intention to use Telegram social network in educational activities with focusing on moderating effect of gender. The statistical population of the research consisted of all M.Sc. students of agricultural majors at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (N= 767). According to the Bartlett et al. table, a sample size of 196 students was selected using a stratified random sampling technique. A standard questionnaire (after adjusting the questions with the field of research) was employed to collect data. The results showed that two variables of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness had a positive and significant effect on attitude toward using telegram in educational activities, whereas, there was not a significant relationship between perceived usefulness and attitude. Also, attitude had a positive and significant effect on agricultural students' intention to use Telegram in educational activities. The results of multi-group analysis indicated that gender had a moderating effect on the relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude toward using Telegram in educational activities, so that the relationship was non-significant for female students, whereas it was positive and significant for male students.},

In this article a method for finding similar texts has been proposed using keyword extraction which operates in linear time like LSH1 method. In addition, it supports dynamic inputs and does not depend on text vector dimensions. Our evaluations show, it has better performance in clustering quality measures and also run time.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of conspiracy theories surrounding George Soros and the `Globalist invasion' had been concentrated primarily in Eastern Europe, Russia and the United States. However, since Jair Bolsonaro's presidential victory in Brazil, Soros has become a target of the far-right in the country. On Soros' 90th Birthday in August 2020, the right-wing group `Movement for Conservative Brazil' (Movimento Brasil Conservador -- MBC) launched a campaign called `International Day Against George Soros', aiming to attack the billionaire's reputation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how this campaign worked across online platforms as a strategy to popularize the Globalism conspiracy theory in the biggest Latin American country. We aim (1) to map the dynamics of disinformation dissemination across chat apps using hyperlink analysis; and (2) to interpret conspiratorial narratives about George Soros shared on chat apps during the month of his 90th birthday. We collected messages mentioning the anti-Soros campaign in WhatsApp and Telegram public groups and channels to extract hyperlinks and domains. These websites were manually categorized in an effort to analyze which conspiracy theories about George Soros are being disseminated on chat apps in Brazil. Our results suggest an increasing cross-platform dissemination of narratives attacking Soros. This case study illustrates how the rise of a transnationally networked political right has been accompanied by an emerging alternative digital communication infrastructure through which conspiracy theories circulate.},

This article aims to discuss the use of technology-in the form of Telegram as one of the mobile phone application-by inserting it in the syllabus related to the teaching and learning English especially for teaching reading. At the end of the discussion, it is found that those variables are influencing each other. Curriculum is as the reference of syllabus whereas syllabus is as the implementation of curriculum and technology supports them. A teacher could use Telegram by setting up a certain group discussion in a single classroom to maximize the learning process. When the teachers provided a Telegram group discussion with its interesting and appropriate context for students, it is possible to make students curious. When the students' curiosity occured, the habitual process of reading begins. This could be one of a problem solving of students' laziness of going to the school library. By the time the students have read several books or articles or another media that they like, the teachers could encourage them to share it with their classmates in some ways by maximizing their Telegram group.},

  abstract = {In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vocal protest scene emerged in Germany. Comparisons to Nazi-Germany, conspiracy topoi, and antisemitic narratives were its prominent companions -- on the streets as well as on social media. One former vegan chef and b-lister became a well-known agitator, culminating in multiple threats to people in public life and blatant, Holocaust-denying antisemitism. This chapter analyzes the development of Attila Hildmann's conspiracist and antisemitic escalation toward a ``superconspiracy'' (Barkun) using a mixed-methods approach. This antisemitic escalation begins with conspiracist narratives and a personalized concept of enemy (predominantly Bill Gates) and moves through prevalent conspiracist themes with antisemitic implications to outright promotion of violence. In the process, implicitly antisemitic references are replaced with open antisemitism. The results confirm that video hosting services and the messenger Telegram are not only important for mobilizing protests, but are also an important resource for analyzing antisemitism in its various forms. This work also proves that a combination of a hermeneutical approach and frequency analysis on multiple platforms is useful for analyzing enormous amounts of diverse data, and for contextualizing the characteristics of narrative structures of conspiracy beliefs.},

  abstract = {Harmful language is frequent in social media, in particular in spaces which are considered anonymous and/or allow free participation. In this paper, we analyze the language in a Telegram channel populated by followers of former US President Donald Trump. We seek to identify the ways in which harmful language is used to create a specific narrative in a group of mostly like-minded discussants. Our research has several aims. First, we create an extended taxonomy of potentially harmful language that includes not only hate speech and direct insults (which have been the focus of existing computational methods), but also other forms of harmful speech discussed in the literature. We manually apply this taxonomy to a large portion of the corpus, including the time period leading up to and the aftermath of the January 2021 US Capitol riot. Our data gives empirical evidence for harmful speech, such as in/out-group divisive language and the use of codes within certain communities, that have not often been investigated before. Second, we compare our manual annotations of harmful speech to several automatic methods for classifying hate speech and offensive language, namely list-based and machine-learning-based approaches. We find that the Telegram data sets still pose particular challenges for these automatic methods. Finally, we argue for the value of studying such naturally-occurring, coherent data sets for research on online harm and how to address it in linguistics and philosophy.},

This study examined how community building emerges in the messages of Dutch anti-vaccination Telegram groups. Particularly, we investigated the extent to which these groups provide a platform for sharing information, perpetuating a shared identity, and promoting action. As negative emotions are considered a prime driver of collective action, we examined to what extent the messages had a negative valence. We used a mixed-method approach through a quantitative content analysis of 4654 text messages from five Telegram groups, while also examining the nature of the content through a qualitative analysis. The results suggest that most messages contained a form of shared identity (ingroup favoritism and outgroup hostility) or (mis)information, and, to a lesser extent, encouragements for (online) action. Moreover, most content had a negative valence. These findings illustrate how online groups might be sources of (mis)information, polarization, and intergroup hostility.},

We study the movements' discourse using several indicators of radicalization dynamics. The increasing prevalence of conspiracy narratives, anti-elitism, political activism, and support for violence indicate radicalization dynamics in these movements' online communication.

Peasants, serfs, untouchables, slaves, laborers, and prisoners are not free to speak their minds in the presence of power. These subordinate groups instead create a secret discourse that represents a critique of power spoken behind the backs of the dominant. At the same time, the powerful also develop a private dialogue about practices and goals of their rule that cannot be openly avowed.In this book, renowned social scientist James C. Scott offers a penetrating discussion both of the public roles played by the powerful and powerless and the mocking, vengeful tone they display off stage---what he terms their public and hidden transcripts. Using examples from the literature, history, and politics of cultures around the world, Scott examines the many guises this interaction has taken throughout history and the tensions and contradictions it reflects.},

  abstract = {This paper re-examines the concept of ``meme'' in the context of digital culture. Defined as cultural units that spread from person to person, memes were debated long before the digital era. Yet the Internet turned the spread of memes into a highly visible practice, and the term has become an integral part of the netizen vernacular. After evaluating the promises and pitfalls of memes for understanding digital culture, I address the problem of defining memes by charting a communication-oriented typology of 3 memetic dimensions: content, form, and stance. To illustrate the utility of the typology, I apply it to analyze the video meme ``Leave Britney Alone.'' Finally, I chart possible paths for further meme-oriented analysis of digital content.},

  abstract = {Conspiracy theories, particularly those focused on anti-vaccine narratives and the promotion of off-label medications such as MMS and CDS, have proliferated on Telegram, including in Brazil, finding fertile ground among communities that share esoteric beliefs and distrust towards scientific institutions. In this context, this study seeks to answer how Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram are characterized and articulated concerning anti-vaccine themes and off-label medications? It is important to highlight that this study is part of a series of seven studies aimed at understanding and characterizing Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram. This series of seven studies is openly and originally available on the arXiv of Cornell University, applying a mirrored method across all studies, changing only the thematic object of analysis and providing replicable research, including proprietary and original codes developed, contributing to the culture of free and open-source software. Regarding the main findings of this study, it was observed: Themes such as the New World Order and Apocalypse and Survivalism act as significant gateways to anti-vaccine narratives, connecting them to theories of global control; Globalism and New World Order stand out as the main communities receiving invitations from anti-vaccine communities; Occultism and Esotericism emerge as the largest sources of invitations to off-label medication communities, creating a strong connection between esoteric beliefs and the promotion of non-scientific treatments; Anti-vaccine narratives experienced a 290\% increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidencing a growing interconnectedness with other conspiracy theories; The overlap of themes between anti-vaccine and other conspiracy theories creates an interdependent disinformation network, where different narratives mutually reinforce each other.},

Argumenta-se que somente {\'e} poss{\'i}vel compreender sociologicamente o padr{\~a}o e a intensidade da viol{\^e}ncia de Estado no Brasil na atualidade se considerarmos o processo hist{\'o}rico de racializa{\c c}{\~a}o de parte da popula{\c c}{\~a}o. Para tanto, reconstruo, inicialmente, o processo de institucionaliza{\c c}{\~a}o da cidadania no Brasil, atentando para o modo como a hierarquia racial presente na sociedade impactou no acesso aos direitos constitucionalmente garantidos. Em um segundo momento, analiso o modo como, historicamente, os direitos civis da popula{\c c}{\~a}o negra foram limitados pelo racismo presente nas institui{\c c}{\~o}es policiais e jur{\'i}dicas.

  abstract = {Background The development of COVID-19 vaccines has been crucial in fighting the pandemic. However, misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines is spread on social media platforms at a rate that has made the World Health Organization coin the phrase infodemic. False claims about adverse vaccine side effects, such as vaccines being the cause of autism, were already considered a threat to global health before the outbreak of COVID-19. Objective We aimed to synthesize the existing research on misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines spread on social media platforms and its effects. The secondary aim was to gain insight and gather knowledge about whether misinformation about autism and COVID-19 vaccines is being spread on social media platforms. Methods We performed a literature search on September 9, 2021, and searched PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. We included publications in peer-reviewed journals that fulfilled the following criteria: original empirical studies, studies that assessed social media and misinformation, and studies about COVID-19 vaccines. Thematic analysis was used to identify the patterns (themes) of misinformation. Narrative qualitative synthesis was undertaken with the guidance of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 Statement and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis reporting guideline. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool. Ratings of the certainty of evidence were based on recommendations from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group. Results The search yielded 757 records, with 45 articles selected for this review. We identified 3 main themes of misinformation: medical misinformation, vaccine development, and conspiracies. Twitter was the most studied social media platform, followed by Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. A vast majority of studies were from industrialized Western countries. We identified 19 studies in which the effect of social media misinformation on vaccine hesitancy was measured or discussed. These studies implied that the misinformation spread on social media had a negative effect on vaccine hesitancy and uptake. Only 1 study contained misinformation about autism as a side effect of COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions To prevent these misconceptions from taking hold, health authorities should openly address and discuss these false claims with both cultural and religious awareness in mind. Our review showed that there is a need to examine the effect of social media misinformation on vaccine hesitancy with a more robust experimental design. Furthermore, this review also demonstrated that more studies are needed from the Global South and on social media platforms other than the major platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

Os autores utilizaram uma an{\'a}lise tem{\'a}tica para revisar 45 artigos selecionados de um total de 757 registros. Foi identificado que a desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o nas redes sociais tem um efeito negativo sobre a hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal. No entanto, apenas um estudo mencionou especificamente a desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o ligando vacinas contra a COVID-19 ao autismo, uma teoria j{\'a} desacreditada em rela{\c c}{\~a}o a outras vacinas, como a tr{\'i}plice viral (MMR).
\par
A desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o observada inclui alega{\c c}{\~o}es sobre efeitos colaterais graves, como infertilidade, altera{\c c}{\~o}es no DNA e o uso de microchips, bem como teorias de conspira{\c c}{\~a}o que sugerem que elites corruptas ou grandes empresas farmac{\^e}uticas est{\~a}o envolvidas na cria{\c c}{\~a}o das vacinas com inten{\c c}{\~o}es nefastas. Esses rumores podem afetar significativamente a aceita{\c c}{\~a}o da vacina, especialmente entre aqueles que dependem das redes sociais como principal fonte de informa{\c c}{\~a}o.
\par
Embora alguns estudos tenham sugerido que plataformas como Twitter e YouTube t{\^e}m conseguido limitar a dissemina{\c c}{\~a}o de desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o, a an{\'a}lise mostrou que ainda h{\'a} muito trabalho a ser feito, especialmente em plataformas emergentes como TikTok e em regi{\~o}es fora do mundo ocidental. Outro aspecto cr{\'i}tico destacado no artigo {\'e} a necessidade de estudos mais robustos para entender melhor os efeitos da desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o na hesita{\c c}{\~a}o vacinal.
\par
O artigo conclui que {\'e} crucial abordar a desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o com consci{\^e}ncia cultural e religiosa, adaptando as campanhas de sa{\'u}de p{\'u}blica para combater mitos espec{\'i}ficos. A revis{\~a}o tamb{\'e}m aponta para a import{\^a}ncia de expandir a pesquisa para pa{\'i}ses do Sul Global, onde h{\'a} menos dados dispon{\'i}veis. Al{\'e}m disso, as autoridades de sa{\'u}de precisam continuar aprimorando suas estrat{\'e}gias para combater a infodemia, que a Organiza{\c c}{\~a}o Mundial da Sa{\'u}de define como uma explos{\~a}o de informa{\c c}{\~o}es falsas ou enganosas.
\par
A recomenda{\c c}{\~a}o final {\'e} que mais pesquisas experimentais sejam conduzidas para entender melhor o impacto da desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o nas atitudes vacinais. Isso deve incluir abordagens {\'e}ticas e controladas, al{\'e}m de aumentar a vigil{\^a}ncia sobre como a desinforma{\c c}{\~a}o se espalha e influencia o comportamento social.}

RQ1: How is pro-hydroxychloroquine content propagated on YouTube? RQ2: How does YouTube's recommendation system suggest videos about hydroxychloroquine on the platform? We use mixed methods (content analysis and social network analysis) to analyze 751 YouTube videos. We found that most pro-HCQ videos in our dataset are posted by mainstream media channels (RQ1) and that YouTube was more likely to recommend pro-HCQ videos than anti-HCQ videos (RQ2). Consequently, the Brazilian mainstream media and YouTube's algorithms fueled the spread of pro-HCQ content.

  abstract = {Background: The recent introduction of COVID-19 certificates in several countries, including the introduction of the European green pass, has been met with protests and concerns by a fraction of the population. In Italy, the green pass has been used as a nudging measure to incentivize vaccinations because a valid green pass is needed to enter restaurants, bars, museums, or stadiums. As of December 2021, a valid green pass can be obtained by being fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine, recovered from COVID-19, or tested. However, a green pass obtained with a test has a short validity (48 hours for the rapid test, 72 hours for the polymerase chain reaction test) and does not allow access to several indoor public places. Objective: This study aims to understand and describe the concerns of individuals opposed to the green pass in Italy, the main arguments of their discussions, and their characterization. Methods: We collected data from Telegram chats and analyzed the arguments and concerns that were raised by the users by using a mixed methods approach. Results: Most individuals opposing the green pass share antivaccine views, but doubts and concerns about vaccines are generally not among the arguments raised to oppose the green pass. Instead, the discussion revolves around the legal aspects and the definition of personal freedom. We explain the differences and similarities between antivaccine and anti--green pass discourses, and we discuss the ethical ramifications of our research, focusing on the use of Telegram chats as a social listening tool for public health. Conclusions: A large portion of individuals opposed to the green pass share antivaccine views. We suggest public health and political institutions to provide a legal explanation and a context for the use of the green pass, as well as to continue focusing on vaccine communication to inform vaccine-hesitant individuals. Further work is needed to define a consensual ethical framework for social listening for public health.},

To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. Our research contributes to this field by exploring the potential of multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. Our work uses the BERTopic topic modeling approach in combination with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data. We analyze a corpus of {\textasciitilde}40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories and other deceptive content. We explore the potentials and challenges of this approach for studying a medium-sized corpus of user-generated, text-image online content. We offer insights into the dominant topics across modalities, different text and image genres discovered during the analysis, quantitative inter-modal topic analyses, and a qualitative case study of textual, visual, and multimodal narrative strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories.},

  abstract = {Social media platforms and news organisations alike are struggling with identifying and combating visual mis/disinformation presented to their audiences. Such processes are complicated due to the enormous number of media items being produced, how quickly media items spread, and the often-subtle or sometimes invisible-to-the-naked-eye nature of deceptive edits. Despite knowing little about the provenance and veracity of the visual content they encounter, journalists have to quickly determine whether to re-publish or amplify this content, with few tools and little time available to assist them in such an evaluation. With the goal of equipping journalists with the mechanisms, skills, and knowledge to be effective gatekeepers and stewards of the public trust, this study reviews current journalistic image verification practices, examines a number of existing and emerging image verification technologies that could be deployed or adapted to aid in this endeavour, and identifies the strengths and limitations of the most promising extant technical approaches. While oriented towards practical and achievable steps in combating visual mis/disinformation, the study also contributes to discussions on fact-checking, source-checking, verification, debunking and journalism training and education.},

But they do not wreak their damage equally across populations, and every disaster has social dimensions at its very core. This important book sheds light on the social conditions and on the global, national, and local processes that produce disasters. Topics covered include the social roots of disaster vulnerability, exposure to natural hazards such as hurricanes and tsunamis as a form of environmental injustice, and emerging threats. Written by a leading expert in the field, this book provides the necessary frameworks for understanding hazards and disasters, exploring the contributions of very different social science fields to disaster research and showing how these ideas have evolved over time. Bringing the social aspects of recent devastating disasters to the forefront, Tierney discusses the challenges of conducting research in the aftermath of disasters and critiques the concept of disaster resilience, which has come to be seen as a key to disaster risk reduction. Peppered with case studies, research examples, and insights from very different disciplines, this rich introduction is an invaluable resource to students and scholars interested in the social nature of disasters and their relation to broader social forces.},

The community is dominated by racist nationalist discourse that combines textual commentary with photographs and other visual media that have been remediated into offensive visual jokes, which ``cloak'' the racism. Through an in-depth study of user-submitted comments and visual jokes, this article argues that the ``cloaks'' that obscure online racism can be at once highly obvious and highly effective. Rather than unmasking obscured racist online ideologies, scholars must also examine how racism flourishes while hiding in plain sight by tracing how racist discourses assemble in participatory media communities.},

  abstract = {Policymakers, scholars, and practitioners have all called attention to the issue of misinformation in the climate change debate. But what is climate change misinformation, who is involved, how does it spread, why does it matter, and what can be done about it? Climate change misinformation is closely linked to climate change skepticism, denial, and contrarianism. A network of actors are involved in financing, producing, and amplifying misinformation. Once in the public domain, characteristics of online social networks, such as homophily, polarization, and echo chambers---characteristics also found in climate change debate---provide fertile ground for misinformation to spread. Underlying belief systems and social norms, as well as psychological heuristics such as confirmation bias, are further factors which contribute to the spread of misinformation. A variety of ways to understand and address misinformation, from a diversity of disciplines, are discussed. These include educational, technological, regulatory, and psychological-based approaches. No single approach addresses all concerns about misinformation, and all have limitations, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach to tackle this multifaceted issue. Key research gaps include understanding the diffusion of climate change misinformation on social media, and examining whether misinformation extends to climate alarmism, as well as climate denial. This article explores the concepts of misinformation and disinformation and defines disinformation to be a subset of misinformation. A diversity of disciplinary and interdisciplinary literature is reviewed to fully interrogate the concept of misinformation---and within this, disinformation---particularly as it pertains to climate change.

This editorial explores this `reactionary turn' in digital culture through a collection of articles and commentaries on `the micropolitics of online oppositional subcultures'. In the special theme, these range from commentaries on how misogyny and hate speech exploit platform affordances to articles tracing the growth and spread of arcane memes and anti-vaccine discourse on Reddit and Telegram. While these phenomena might elsewhere be labeled as instances of misinformation, the editorial frames them in terms of `reactionary sensemaking', in which digital subcultures form communities in reaction to a perceived loss of meaning and out of a shared antipathy to `mainstream' culture. Methodologically, the editorial situates these studies in terms of a broader `micropolitical' research tradition that extends from Latour and Deleuze back to Tarde.},

  abstract = {Online messaging app Telegram has increased in popularity in recent years surpassing Twitter and Snapchat by the number of active monthly users in late 2020. The messenger has also been crucial to protest movements in several countries in 2019-2020, including Belarus, Russia and Hong Kong. Yet, to date only few studies examined online activities on Telegram and none have analyzed the platform with regard to the protest mobilization. In the present study, we address the existing gap by examining Telegram-based activities related to the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. With this paper we aim to provide an example of methodological tools that can be used to study protest mobilization and coordination on Telegram. We also contribute to the research on computational text analysis in Cantonese---one of the low-resource Asian languages,---as well as to the scholarship on Hong Kong protests and research on social media-based protest mobilization in general. For that, we rely on the data collected through Telegram's API and a combination of network analysis and computational text analysis. We find that the Telegram-based network was cohesive ensuring efficient spread of protest-related information. Content spread through Telegram predominantly concerned discussions of future actions and protest-related on-site information (i.e., police presence in certain areas). We find that the Telegram network was dominated by different actors each month of the observation suggesting the absence of one single leader. Further, traditional protest leaders---those prominent during the 2014 Umbrella Movement,---such as media and civic organisations were less prominent in the network than local communities. Finally, we observe a cooldown in the level of Telegram activity after the enactment of the harsh National Security Law in July 2020. Further investigation is necessary to assess the persistence of this effect in a long-term perspective.},

Methodology: This is a descriptive-analytic research conducted through a survey method. In the first part, two checklists were provided for the academic library services as well as activities of the central libraries of the universities of MSRT (including Sharif University of Technology, University of Isfahan, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, and Shahid Chamran University of Ahwaz) providing services. In the second part, a researcher-made questionnaire was distributed among 102 managers and librarians of the mentioned libraries which launched a Telegram channel in 2015-2016. Data were analyzed in two levels of descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS Software. Results: The findings showed that information services were provided at three central libraries of the Sharif University of Technology, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and Shahid Chamran University of Ahwaz, and borrowing services at the central library of the University of Isfahan. The data analysis of the questionnaire revealed that managers and librarians' attituded for the development of library services including borrowing with a mean of 3.50, informing with a mean of 3.39, reference with a mean of 3.29, information technology with a mean of 3.30, and education and research with a mean of 3.35, which was generally at moderate mean. There was also a positive and significant relationship between the variables of the Telegram social network and the academic library services. Conclusion: The results of the research showed that most libraries used the social network of Telegram to present news and events of the library. Considering the importance and efficiency of the Telegram social network in providing the borrowing services, informing, reference, information technology and education and research, it is suggested that related measures should be considered for its proper use in relation to the development of academic library services through Telegram.},

Deplatformization is different from deplatforming: it entails a systemic effort to push back encroaching radical right-wing platforms to the fringes of the ecosystem by denying them the infrastructural services needed to function online. We identify several deplatformization strategies, using Gab as an example of a platform that survived its relegation and which subsequently tried to build an alternative at the edge of the mainstream ecosystem. Evaluating deplatformization in terms of governance, the question that arises is who is responsible for cleansing the ecosystem: corporations, states, civil society actors, or all three combined? Understanding the implied governance of deplatformization is imperative to assess the higher stakes in future debates concerning Internet governability.},

We deploy the concept of geography of death to investigate the multi-layered aspects of state-sanctioned lethal violence perpetrated by, but not limited to, the police force. This entails a consideration of at least three types of factor: actual violent acts, their symbolic dimensions and the historical and structural conditions within which violence emerges. Based on official data from the Brazilian state we argue that there is a perverse correlation between vulnerability to death and new racial formations, as they intersect with social class, age, gender, and place. Thus, the distinctive social geographies of S{\~a}o Paulo not only provide the context, but also define the very nature, frequency and experience of police violence. Ultimately, we argue, police lethality is a manifestation of the police and the state's complicity in reproducing boundaries of privilege and exclusion.},

  abstract = {Lies spread faster than the truth                            There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi               et al.               used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by {$\sim$}3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1146                        ,              A large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth.           ,              We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise {\textasciitilde}126,000 stories tweeted by {\textasciitilde}3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

  abstract = {Just as social media has permeated communication in our public and private lives, it has also become a widely used source of data and object of study in academic and commercial research. Despite widespread use, relatively little is known about how social media datasets change when observed at different points over time or how collection methods may impact the data at the core of our research projects. For example: Will results differ if social media data are collected in real-time, a few minutes after production, hours, days, or weeks later?  What happens to the metadata, links to web pages, photos, and videos embedded in this content over time? If data collection methods do not preserve and archive social media posts, metadata, and linked content; are researchers venturing into a new dataset each time they engage with it? In this dissertation, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches are used to examine how social media datasets change over time and how change impacts the reliability and authenticity of this data. Three Twitter-based case studies, each exhibiting prototypical elements social scientists encounter in their research are used to demonstrate the impact of research design and data collection choices. This work advances the field of information science by empirically investigating how the ephemeral nature of social media data, metadata, and linked content have significant and lasting effects on the reliability and authenticity of datasets used in research. By situating research design decisions of how and when to observe data within the frameworks of process theory, infrastructure studies, and archival theory, this work brings the importance of methodological considerations to the forefront of studies of digital and social media. Empirical observations inform a set of implications for social media research, offering researchers practical considerations to inform their research designs.},

E5 can be readily used as a general-purpose embedding model for any tasks requiring a single-vector representation of texts such as retrieval, clustering, and classification, achieving strong performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We conduct extensive evaluations on 56 datasets from the BEIR and MTEB benchmarks. For zero-shot settings, E5 is the first model that outperforms the strong BM25 baseline on the BEIR retrieval benchmark without using any labeled data. When fine-tuned, E5 obtains the best results on the MTEB benchmark, beating existing embedding models with 40x more parameters.},

At the heart of the CIC's inquiry was the high death-rate of poor black Brazilian youth killed violently and whether the State should be held directly or indirectly accountable for it. The CIC's self-explanatory title points to its investigative purpose. Grounded as it is on the proceedings this congressional inquest, this work is a critical review of the varying positions upheld by the various actors who took part in it. Using content analysis as its methodological framework - from the standpoint of Sociology - the focus is on analyzing the concepts and meanings behind the presentations by the plethora of players who participated in the CIC's hearings on Violence Against Poor Black Youth. The ensuing debates circled around two main interrogation points: a) is there a genocide in progress in Brazil against its black population, principally black youth? and b) can racism be said to be the direct or indirect cause of the homicidal violence directed at the black population, with specific reference to its youth? The CIC's Final Report concluded that there was indeed a ``symbolic genocide'' taking place in Brazil and that such a circumstance was attributable to the prevalence of an ``institutional racism'' in Brazilian society. This work concludes that the term ``symbolic genocide'', embraced by the CIC, is intended to bridge two divergent currents of thought, both with support in Brazilian society per se: a) those who assert that there is racism and genocide in Brazil; b) those who deny such contentions. In which case, the Final Report opted to navigate a middle course between those ``two Brazil'' when it found safe haven in the term ``symbolic genocide''. Indeed, that term removes the possibility of accusing the Brazilian State of perpetrating genocide - an internationally proscribed and punishable crime - against a section of its own population.},

We argue that memes are remixed, iterated messages which are rapidly spread by members of participatory digital culture for the purpose of continuing a conversation. We understand that memes develop from emergent memes, which we define as altered or remixed spreadable media. We have adapted and modified Jenkins' term ``spreadable media'' to refer to original or non-parodied messages. Our analysis benefits from the inclusion of Anthony Giddens' structuration theory to aid in understanding how memes as artifacts of participatory digital culture are created. Our genre development of memes demonstrates the generative capacity for continued memetic transformation and for participation among members of digital culture. We use structuration to position these dynamic components as the core of a duality of structure for Internet memes.},

The Russian government has instrumentalized ostensibly sound legitimations -- countering terrorist and extremist propaganda, combatting child pornography -- to bring about a dramatic decline in internet freedom. While these policies have been widely studied, scholarship examining how the Russian government legitimates and cultivates popular support for restricting online freedoms remains scarce. This article therefore studies how restrictions of internet freedom are framed in political and media discourses. It focuses on the case of Telegram, a popular messaging application that was banned in Russia in April 2018 for its refusal to provide the FSB with access to encrypted messages in compliance with anti-terrorism legislation. It finds that media framing of the ban was more diverse than the official governmental line. While national security framing was important, the `rule of law' frame occurred most frequently, and conspiracy framing was markedly infrequent.},

  abstract = {Political polarization on the digital sphere poses a real challenge to many democracies around the world. Although the issue has received some scholarly attention, there is a need to improve the conceptual precision in the increasingly blurry debate. The use of computational communication science approaches allows us to track political conversations in a fine-grained manner within their natural settings -- the realm of interactive social media. The present study combines different algorithmic approaches to studying social media data in order to capture both the interactional structure and content of dynamic political talk online. We conducted an analysis of political polarization across social media platforms (analyzing Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) over 16~months, with close to a quarter million online contributions regarding a political controversy in Israel. Our comprehensive measurement of interactive political talk enables us to address three key aspects of political polarization: (1) interactional polarization -- homophilic versus heterophilic user interactions; (2) positional polarization -- the positions expressed, and (3) affective polarization -- the emotions and attitudes expressed. Our findings indicate that political polarization on social media cannot be conceptualized as a unified phenomenon, as there are significant cross-platform differences. While interactions on Twitter largely conform to established expectations (homophilic interaction patterns, aggravating positional polarization, pronounced inter-group hostility), on WhatsApp, de-polarization occurred over time. Surprisingly, Facebook was found to be the least homophilic platform in terms of interactions, positions, and emotions expressed. Our analysis points to key conceptual distinctions and raises important questions about the drivers and dynamics of political polarization online.},

There is no doubt that the frequency and quality of ISIS posts on the Internet, including their videos, memes and online journals are of a quality to make many professional editors and producers envious and they also receive much attention.  Telegram has become the choice of the ISIS due to its specifications---providing secure encrypted communications and allowing users to share large files and act with their accounts operating with impunity. While Telegram administrators claim, they favor speech free of interference; it is time for the owners of Telegram to thoroughly consider the existence of ISIS presence and activities on their digital platform. Telegram has become the ultimate tool for the bloodiest terrorist organization in history, carrying and spreading its terrorist ideology around the world, recruiting and even directing cadres to carry out attacks globally. Recently, the families of the San Bernardino shooting sued Facebook, Google, and Twitter, claiming that these social media companies permitted ISIS to flourish on these social media platforms . It may soon happen that Telegram will also have to deal with several legal actions as ISIS cadres continue to utilize their application for their terror operations and communications. http://moderndiplomacy.eu/index.php?option=com\_k2\&view=item\&id=2564:telegram-the-mighty-application-that-isis-loves\&Itemid=154 Reference for this Article: Yayla, Ahmet S. \& Speckhard, Anne (May 9, 2017) Telegram: the Mighty Application that ISIS Loves, ICSVE Brief Reports, http://www.icsve.org/brief-reports/telegram-the-mighty-application-that-isis-loves/}

This study examines the news coverage about COVID-19 in relation to Asians, mainly Chinese and China, on YouTube channels of major U.S. media outlets, and explores the relationship between the media framing and anti-Asian sentiments embedded in the comments beneath the news video. By content analyzing 50 news videos covering COVID-19 and Asians from 5 U.S. media organizations and 5000 comments, the findings suggest that attribution of responsibility and conflict are the most frequently used frames by the news reporting. The results also reveal that suspicion of conspiracy, rather than blaming, emerged as the most frequent theme embedded in hateful comments. One promising finding is that the frequency of hateful comments is significantly lower than that of non-hateful comments across all news frame categories.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the search for health information on the Internet and to determine the frequency and main means of spreading fake health news. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted through the virtual distribution of questionnaires on social media platforms in 2019 by using the snowball technique. The questionnaire collected information regarding sociodemographics, means used to clarify doubts about health, implementation of information obtained through the Internet, receipt of fake news, and means of transmission of fake news. Quantitative variables are described as means and standard deviations, and categorical variables are described as frequencies and percentages. The chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used. RESULTS: Out of 1,195 respondents, 53\% had followed Internet guidance without consulting a health professional, especially young people and individuals with low education levels (p{$<$}0.05). The resources most used to answer questions about health were a physician (78\%) and Google (51\%), and searches using the latter were more predominant among younger age groups (p{$<$}0.05). A large part of the sample (89.4\%) had received fake news, and the main means of receipt were Facebook and WhatsApp. CONCLUSIONS: The Internet was the second most commonly used means to search for health information. A significant portion of the population adopts actions based on this information. The frequency of broadcasting fake news through this digital medium is high.},

The objective of this study is two-fold: First, it introduces the concept of dark platforms, which differ from their mainstream counterparts in terms of content governance, user-base and technological infrastructure. Second, using 8kun and Gab as examples, this study investigates how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been communicated on dark platforms, with a focus on conspiracy theories. Over 60,000 COVID-19-related posts were studied to identify the most prominent conspiracy theories, their themes, and the actors who promoted them, as well as the broader information ecosystem through network analysis. While pressure on social media to deplatform conspiracy theorists continues to grow, we argue that more research needs to be done to critically investigate the impacts of further marginalizing such groups. To this end, the concept of dark platform as can serve as a heuristic device for researching a wider range of fringe platforms.},

Data indicates that hundreds of thousands of people globally, including children, have been exposed. We present governing equations derived from first principles and a tipping-point condition predicting future surges in content transmission. Using the U.S. Capitol attack and a 2023 mass shooting as case studies, our findings offer actionable insights and quantitative predictions down to the hourly scale.
